<p>It is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span> universally acknowledged, that a single <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>possession</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.275" formerWord="possession" newWord="retirement" score="0.275">retirement</span> of a good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span>, must be in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="want" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span>. 
<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> may be on his first entering a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.675">duty</span>, this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span> is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>property</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.737" formerWord="property" newWord="degree" score="0.737">degree</span> of some one or other of their daughters. 
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet,"said his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span> to him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>,"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. 
<p>"But it is,"returned she;"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
<p>Mr. Bennet made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>. 
<p>"Do you not want to know who has taken it?"cried his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span> impatiently. 
<p>"You want to tell me, and I have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.31" formerWord="objection" newWord="sentiment" score="0.31">sentiment</span> to hearing it."
<p>This was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="invitation" newWord="aunt" score="0.96">aunt</span> enough. 
<p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> of large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>north</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.597" formerWord="north" newWord="nature" score="0.597">nature</span> of England; that he came down on Monday in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chaise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.298" formerWord="chaise" newWord="met" score="0.298">met</span> and four to see the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>possession</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.275" formerWord="possession" newWord="retirement" score="0.275">retirement</span> before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="end" newWord="time" score="0.984">time</span> of next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span>."
<p>"What is his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="name" newWord="family" score="0.971">family</span>?"
<p>"Bingley."
<p>"Is he married or single?"
<p>"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> of large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span>; four or five thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>. What a fine <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> for our girls!"
<p>"How so? How can it affect them?"
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet,"replied his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span>,"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
<p>"Is that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.429" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.429">wife</span> in settling here?"
<p>"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.429" formerWord="Design" newWord="wife" score="0.429">Wife</span>! <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nonsense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="Nonsense" newWord="person" score="0.722">Person</span>, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
<p>"I see no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="occasion" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span> for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>."
<p>"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>share</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.466" formerWord="share" newWord="horror" score="0.466">horror</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="beauty" newWord="family" score="0.975">family</span>, but I do not pretend to be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> extraordinary now. When a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thinking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="thinking" newWord="duty" score="0.605">duty</span> of her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="beauty" newWord="family" score="0.975">family</span>."
<p>"In such cases, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> has not often much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="beauty" newWord="family" score="0.975">family</span> to think of."
<p>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.675">duty</span>."
<p>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
<p>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>establishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.477" formerWord="establishment" newWord="satisfaction" score="0.477">satisfaction</span> it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.991">family</span>, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not."
<p>"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="consent" newWord="brother" score="0.966">brother</span> to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> for my little Lizzy."
<p>"I <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.856">kindness</span> you will do no such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.77" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.77">minute</span> so handsome as Jane, nor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.77" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.77">minute</span> so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
<p>"They have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="none" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> of them much to recommend them,"replied he;"they are all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.546" formerWord="silly" newWord="disposition" score="0.546">disposition</span> and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> more of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quickness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.691" formerWord="quickness" newWord="horror" score="0.691">horror</span> than her sisters."
<p>"Mr. Bennet, how can you <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abuse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.234" formerWord="abuse" newWord="vault" score="0.234">vault</span> your own children in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>? You take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.523" formerWord="delight" newWord="observation" score="0.523">observation</span> in vexing me. You have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="compassion" newWord="family" score="0.961">family</span> for my poor nerves."
<p>"You <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="mistake" newWord="time" score="0.949">time</span> me, my dear. I have a high <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="respect" newWord="happiness" score="0.955">happiness</span> for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.914" formerWord="consideration" newWord="affection" score="0.914">affection</span> these last twenty years at least."
<p>"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
<p>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span> come into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.675">duty</span>."
<p>"It will be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.502" formerWord="use" newWord="suffering" score="0.502">suffering</span> to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
<p>"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."
<p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mixture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.612" formerWord="mixture" newWord="gallery" score="0.612">gallery</span> of quick parts, sarcastic <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.929" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.929">journey</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.385" formerWord="reserve" newWord="weather" score="0.385">weather</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>caprice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.471" formerWord="caprice" newWord="minute" score="0.471">minute</span>, that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>experience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="experience" newWord="horror" score="0.783">horror</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>three-and-twenty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.329" formerWord="three-and-twenty" newWord="minute" score="0.329">minute</span> years had been insufficient to make his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span> understand his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span>. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="mind" newWord="man" score="0.951">man</span> was less difficult to develop. She was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> of mean <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>understanding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.721" formerWord="understanding" newWord="dinner" score="0.721">dinner</span>, little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="information" newWord="situation" score="0.86">situation</span>, and uncertain <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="temper" newWord="woman" score="0.897">woman</span>. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.

<p>Chapter 2 
<p>
<p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span> that he should not go; and till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span> was paid she had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>knowledge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.872" formerWord="knowledge" newWord="pleasure" score="0.872">pleasure</span> of it. It was then disclosed in the following <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>. Observing his second <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> employed in trimming a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.431" formerWord="hat" newWord="park" score="0.431">park</span>, he suddenly addressed her with: 
<p>"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
<p>"We are not in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to know what Mr. Bingley likes,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> resentfully,"since we are not to visit."
<p>"But you forget, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="mamma" newWord="friend" score="0.89">friend</span>,"said Elizabeth,"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."
<p>"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>, and I have no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span> of her."
<p>"No more have I,"said Mr. Bennet;"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."
<p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. 
<p>"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="sake" newWord="company" score="0.756">company</span>! Have a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="compassion" newWord="family" score="0.961">family</span> on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."
<p>"Kitty has no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>discretion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.865" formerWord="discretion" newWord="arrival" score="0.865">arrival</span> in her coughs,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span>;"she times them ill."
<p>"I do not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cough</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.346" formerWord="cough" newWord="stuff" score="0.346">stuff</span> for my own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amusement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="amusement" newWord="way" score="0.86">way</span>,"replied Kitty fretfully."When is your next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span> to be, Lizzy?"
<p>"To-morrow <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.96">affection</span>."
<p>"Aye, so it is,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>,"and Mrs. Long does not come back till the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."
<p>"Then, my dear, you may have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.583" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.583">minute</span> of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her."
<p>"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"
<p>"I <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span> your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>circumspection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.269" formerWord="circumspection" newWord="bitterness" score="0.269">bitterness</span>.

Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span>, and spent the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="walking" newWord="sister" score="0.933">sister</span> about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> occasionally to one of his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> was decided.

<p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="dance" newWord="answer" score="0.902">answer</span> for a few minutes, to press his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> to join it.

<p>"I certainly shall not.

<p>"I would not be so fastidious as you are,"cried Mr. Bingley,"for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kingdom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.412" formerWord="kingdom" newWord="child" score="0.412">child</span>!

<p>"You are dancing with the only handsome <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>,"said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. 
<p>"Oh! She is the most beautiful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>creature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="creature" newWord="woman" score="0.777">woman</span> I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable.

<p>Mr. Bingley followed his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.764" formerWord="advice" newWord="part" score="0.764">part</span>. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>story</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="story" newWord="letter" score="0.837">letter</span>, however, with great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>spirit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="spirit" newWord="day" score="0.952">day</span> among her friends; for she had a lively, playful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disposition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="disposition" newWord="minute" score="0.799">minute</span>, which delighted in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> ridiculous. 
<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> much admired by the Netherfield <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.

Elizabeth felt Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.675">duty</span>; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span>. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>village</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="village" newWord="heart" score="0.893">heart</span> where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.

Jane was so admired, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> could be like it. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Everybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.754" formerWord="Everybody" newWord="word" score="0.754">Word</span> said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!

First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="nobody" newWord="family" score="0.938">family</span> can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="dance" newWord="answer" score="0.902">answer</span>. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger - -"

<p>"But I can assure you,"she added,"that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> of your set-downs.

<p>When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span> of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> just how very much she admired him. 
<p>"He is just what a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> ought to be,"said she,"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="sensible" newWord="conversation" score="0.798">conversation</span>, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! - - so much ease, with such perfect good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breeding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.783" formerWord="breeding" newWord="countenance" score="0.783">countenance</span>!"
<p>"He is also handsome,"replied Elizabeth,"which a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> is thereby complete."
<p>"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>.

<p>"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>difference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="difference" newWord="brother" score="0.976">brother</span> between us.

What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>.

Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span>."
<p>"Dear Lizzy!"
<p>"Oh! you are a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> too apt, you know, to like people in general.

<p>"Certainly not - - at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.

<p>Elizabeth listened in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.956" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.956">sister</span>, but was not convinced; their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assembly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.441" formerWord="assembly" newWord="horror" score="0.441">horror</span> had not been calculated to please in general; and with more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quickness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.691" formerWord="quickness" newWord="horror" score="0.691">horror</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.85">minute</span> and less pliancy of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="temper" newWord="woman" score="0.897">woman</span> than her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, and with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judgement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="judgement" newWord="son" score="0.797">son</span> too unassailed by any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.

<p>"Aye - - because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to."

<p>"That is very true,"replied Elizabeth,"and I could easily forgive his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="pride" newWord="sister" score="0.973">sister</span>, if he had not mortified <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mine</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.351" formerWord="mine" newWord="companion" score="0.351">companion</span>."

<p>"Then you would drink a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> more than you ought,"said Mrs. Bennet;"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>bottle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="bottle" newWord="evening" score="0.725">evening</span> directly."

<p>The ladies of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="family" score="0.971">Family</span> soon waited on those of Netherfield.

It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to be very much in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span>; but she considered with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> that it was not likely to be discovered by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span> in general, since Jane united, with great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>strength</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="strength" newWord="happiness" score="0.924">happiness</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>feeling</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="feeling" newWord="time" score="0.979">time</span>, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>composure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="composure" newWord="minute" score="0.776">minute</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="temper" newWord="woman" score="0.897">woman</span> and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uniform</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.29" formerWord="uniform" newWord="offer" score="0.29">offer</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cheerfulness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.542" formerWord="cheerfulness" newWord="absence" score="0.542">absence</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> Miss Lucas. 
<p>"It may perhaps be pleasant,"replied Charlotte,"to be able to impose on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>public</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.507" formerWord="public" newWord="housekeeper" score="0.507">housekeeper</span> in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>; but it is sometimes a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disadvantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.248" formerWord="disadvantage" newWord="security" score="0.248">security</span> to be so very guarded. If a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> conceals her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> with the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>skill</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.353" formerWord="skill" newWord="devotion" score="0.353">devotion</span> from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> of it, she may lose the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of fixing him; and it will then be but poor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consolation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="consolation" newWord="money" score="0.853">money</span> to believe the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span> equally in the dark. There is so much of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gratitude</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="gratitude" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>vanity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.921" formerWord="vanity" newWord="woman" score="0.921">woman</span> in almost every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.684" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.684">deal</span>, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely - - a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="heart" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> enough to be really in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>encouragement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="encouragement" newWord="brother" score="0.955">brother</span>. In nine cases out of ten a women had better <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>show</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.235" formerWord="show" newWord="neglect" score="0.235">neglect</span> more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> than she feels. Bingley likes your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."
<p>"But she does help him on, as much as her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.94" formerWord="nature" newWord="time" score="0.94">time</span> will allow. If I can perceive her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span> for him, he must be a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>simpleton</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.64" formerWord="simpleton" newWord="ease" score="0.64">ease</span>, indeed, not to discover it too."
<p>"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disposition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="disposition" newWord="minute" score="0.799">minute</span> as you do."
<p>"But if a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> is partial to a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, and does not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>endeavour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.35" formerWord="endeavour" newWord="person" score="0.35">person</span> to conceal it, he must find it out."
<p>"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> should be employed in conversing together.

When she is secure of him, there will be more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>leisure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.307" formerWord="leisure" newWord="station" score="0.307">station</span> for falling in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> as much as she chooses."
<p>"Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>plan</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="plan" newWord="pleasure" score="0.79">pleasure</span> is a good one,"replied Elizabeth,"where <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> is in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.962">time</span> but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.856">kindness</span> of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="husband" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>, or any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="husband" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>, I dare say I should adopt it.

As yet, she cannot even be certain of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>degree</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="degree" newWord="sister" score="0.982">sister</span> of her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span> nor of its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reasonableness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.411" formerWord="reasonableness" newWord="kitchen" score="0.411">kitchen</span>. She has known him only a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.96">affection</span>. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> at his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, and has since dined with him in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="company" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span>."
<p>"Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>appetite</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.268" formerWord="appetite" newWord="sincerity" score="0.268">sincerity</span>; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together - - and four evenings may do a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>."

<p>"Well,"said Charlotte,"I wish Jane <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="success" newWord="man" score="0.888">man</span> with all my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="heart" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="chance" newWord="time" score="0.924">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> as if she were to be studying his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>twelvemonth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.723" formerWord="twelvemonth" newWord="answer" score="0.723">answer</span>. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="Happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">Brother</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> is entirely a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="chance" newWord="time" score="0.924">time</span>.

<p>Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> of some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="interest" newWord="family" score="0.981">family</span> in the eyes of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>.

<p>"I am astonished, my dear,"said Mrs. Bennet,"that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.

<p>In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>field</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="field" newWord="year" score="0.772">year</span> after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>field</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.772" formerWord="field" newWord="year" score="0.772">year</span> at a quick <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.195" formerWord="pace" newWord="remembrance" score="0.195">remembrance</span>, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impatient</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="impatient" newWord="news" score="0.742">news</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>activity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="activity" newWord="aunt" score="0.891">aunt</span>, and finding herself at last within <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.375" formerWord="view" newWord="dirt" score="0.375">dirt</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.255" formerWord="face" newWord="reproach" score="0.255">reproach</span> glowing with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>warmth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.97" formerWord="warmth" newWord="time" score="0.97">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>exercise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.713" formerWord="exercise" newWord="minute" score="0.713">minute</span>.

<p>When <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="dinner" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span> was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>.

<p>"You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley;"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> make such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>exhibition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.328" formerWord="exhibition" newWord="candle" score="0.328">candle</span>."
<p>"Certainly not."

<p>Elizabeth thanked him from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="heart" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, and then walked towards the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.548" formerWord="table" newWord="morning" score="0.548">morning</span> where a few books were lying.

<p>"Upon my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span>, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purchase</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.306" formerWord="purchase" newWord="dining" score="0.306">dining</span> than by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>imitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.275" formerWord="imitation" newWord="slumber" score="0.275">slumber</span>."
<p>Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="book" newWord="mother" score="0.799">mother</span>; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, to observe the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>game</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.597" formerWord="game" newWord="fortnight" score="0.597">fortnight</span>.

<p>Lydia declared herself satisfied."Oh! yes - - it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.

<p>"Thank you - - but I always mend my own."
<p>"How can you contrive to write so even?"
<p>He was silent.

<p>"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?

<p>"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine."

<p>"That will not do for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compliment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="compliment" newWord="day" score="0.889">day</span> to Darcy, Caroline,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span>,"because he does not write with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="ease" newWord="friend" score="0.971">friend</span>.

Miss Bingley moved with some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alacrity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="alacrity" newWord="acquaintance" score="0.813">acquaintance</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pianoforte</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.859" formerWord="pianoforte" newWord="day" score="0.859">day</span>; and, after a polite <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>request</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="request" newWord="none" score="0.808">none</span> that Elizabeth would lead the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. 
<p>Mrs. Hurst sang with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instrument</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.594" formerWord="instrument" newWord="case" score="0.594">case</span>, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>admiration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="admiration" newWord="nothing" score="0.893">nothing</span> to so great a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="notice" newWord="her" score="0.937">her</span> because there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>right</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="right" newWord="nothing" score="0.843">nothing</span>, than in any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>present</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="present" newWord="brother" score="0.959">brother</span>.

<p>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>charm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="charm" newWord="sister" score="0.891">sister</span> by a lively Scotch <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>air</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.491" formerWord="air" newWord="sea" score="0.491">sea</span>; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her: 
<p>"Do not you feel a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="inclination" newWord="mother" score="0.758">mother</span>, Miss Bennet, to seize such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of dancing a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reel</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.319" formerWord="reel" newWord="fable" score="0.319">fable</span>?"
<p>She smiled, but made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>. He repeated the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.962">time</span>, with some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> at her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.956" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.956">sister</span>. 
<p>"Oh!"said she,"I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.

I have, therefore, made up my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="mind" newWord="man" score="0.951">man</span> to tell you, that I do not want to dance a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reel</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.319" formerWord="reel" newWord="fable" score="0.319">fable</span> at all - - and now despise me if you dare."
<p>"Indeed I do not dare."
<p>Elizabeth, having rather expected to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affront</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.637" formerWord="affront" newWord="person" score="0.637">person</span> him, was amazed at his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gallantry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.884" formerWord="gallantry" newWord="end" score="0.884">end</span>; but there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mixture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.612" formerWord="mixture" newWord="gallery" score="0.612">gallery</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sweetness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="sweetness" newWord="minute" score="0.803">minute</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>archness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.377" formerWord="archness" newWord="step" score="0.377">step</span> in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> which made it difficult for her to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affront</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.637" formerWord="affront" newWord="person" score="0.637">person</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.969">way</span>; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> as he was by her.

<p>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anxiety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.898" formerWord="anxiety" newWord="life" score="0.898">life</span> for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>recovery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.802" formerWord="recovery" newWord="character" score="0.802">character</span> of her dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> Jane received some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assistance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.413" formerWord="assistance" newWord="barouche" score="0.413">barouche</span> from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.856">kindness</span> of getting rid of Elizabeth. 
<p>She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>guest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.349" formerWord="guest" newWord="mode" score="0.349">mode</span>, by talking of their supposed <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, and planning his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> in such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alliance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="alliance" newWord="aunt" score="0.784">aunt</span>.

<p>At that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> they were met from another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="walk" newWord="friend" score="0.978">friend</span> by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself. 
<p>"I did not know that you intended to walk,"said Miss Bingley, in some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.345" formerWord="confusion" newWord="curiosity" score="0.345">curiosity</span>, lest they had been overheard.

<p>Then taking the disengaged <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="arm" newWord="course" score="0.974">course</span> of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>path</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.71" formerWord="path" newWord="matter" score="0.71">matter</span> just admitted three.

<p>But Elizabeth, who had not the least <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="inclination" newWord="mother" score="0.758">mother</span> to remain with them, laughingly answered:

<p>She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hope</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="hope" newWord="day" score="0.972">day</span> of being at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> again in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> or two.

Their powers of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> were considerable.

<p>But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span>; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> to say to him before he had advanced many steps.

The first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half-hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.532" formerWord="half-hour" newWord="partner" score="0.532">partner</span> was spent in piling up the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.239" formerWord="fire" newWord="self" score="0.239">self</span>, lest she should suffer from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>change</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="change" newWord="brother" score="0.976">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>; and she removed at his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.856">kindness</span> to the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fireplace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.313" formerWord="fireplace" newWord="water" score="0.313">water</span>, that she might be further from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.978">time</span>. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anyone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.361" formerWord="anyone" newWord="minute" score="0.361">minute</span> else.

<p>When <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="tea" newWord="time" score="0.908">time</span> was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister-in-law</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.297" formerWord="sister-in-law" newWord="stranger" score="0.297">stranger</span> of the card-table - - but in vain. She had obtained private <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="character" score="0.866">character</span> that Mr. Darcy did not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="wish" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>petition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.26" formerWord="petition" newWord="discovery" score="0.26">discovery</span> rejected. She assured him that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> intended to play, and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.956" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.956">sister</span> of the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span> seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="book" newWord="mother" score="0.799">mother</span>; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> with Miss Bennet. 
<p>Miss Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>progress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.773" formerWord="progress" newWord="heart" score="0.773">heart</span> through his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="book" newWord="mother" score="0.799">mother</span>, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.683" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="house" score="0.683">house</span>, or looking at his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>page</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.518" formerWord="page" newWord="chance" score="0.518">chance</span>. She could not win him, however, to any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span>; he merely answered her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.962">time</span>, and read on.

<p>No <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="book" newWord="mother" score="0.799">mother</span>, and cast her eyes round the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.47" formerWord="quest" newWord="behaviour" score="0.47">behaviour</span> for some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amusement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="amusement" newWord="way" score="0.86">way</span>; when hearing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span> mentioning a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span> to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: 
<p>"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="dance" newWord="answer" score="0.902">answer</span> at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span> would be rather a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>punishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.433" formerWord="punishment" newWord="promise" score="0.433">promise</span> than a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>."
<p>"If you mean Darcy,"cried her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span>,"he may go to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>bed</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.249" formerWord="bed" newWord="whip" score="0.249">whip</span>, if he chooses, before it begins - - but as for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span>, it is quite a settled <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>; and as soon as Nicholls has made white <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>soup</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.457" formerWord="soup" newWord="cause" score="0.457">cause</span> enough, I shall send <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="round" newWord="minute" score="0.875">minute</span> my cards."
<p>"I should like balls infinitely better,"she replied,"if they were carried on in a different <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>; but there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> insufferably tedious in the usual <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>process</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.245" formerWord="process" newWord="mine" score="0.245">mine</span> of such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meeting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.936" formerWord="meeting" newWord="family" score="0.936">family</span>. It would surely be much more rational if <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> instead of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dancing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="dancing" newWord="brother" score="0.962">brother</span> were made the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>order</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="order" newWord="way" score="0.909">way</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>."
<p>"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span>."
<p>Miss Bingley made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>figure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.834" formerWord="figure" newWord="week" score="0.834">week</span> was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desperation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.257" formerWord="desperation" newWord="principal" score="0.257">principal</span> of her feelings, she resolved on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>effort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.239" formerWord="effort" newWord="excursion" score="0.239">excursion</span> more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said: 
<p>"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>example</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.336" formerWord="example" newWord="rumour" score="0.336">rumour</span>, and take a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>turn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.281" formerWord="turn" newWord="control" score="0.281">control</span> about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>.

<p>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="civility" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>awake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.249" formerWord="awake" newWord="ridge" score="0.249">ridge</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>novelty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.834" formerWord="novelty" newWord="way" score="0.834">way</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quarter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.24" formerWord="quarter" newWord="ingenuousness" score="0.24">ingenuousness</span> as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>book</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="book" newWord="mother" score="0.799">mother</span>. He was directly invited to join their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span> together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere."What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meaning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="meaning" newWord="day" score="0.796">day</span>?"- - and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? 
<p>"Not at all,"was her answer;"but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> of disappointing him will be to ask <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> about it."
<p>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>, and persevered therefore in requiring an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>explanation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.92" formerWord="explanation" newWord="mother" score="0.92">mother</span> of his two motives. 
<p>"I have not the smallest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.31" formerWord="objection" newWord="sentiment" score="0.31">sentiment</span> to explaining them,"said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak."You either choose this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>method</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.298" formerWord="method" newWord="field" score="0.298">field</span> of passing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> because you are in each other's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confidence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="confidence" newWord="heart" score="0.877">heart</span>, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.583" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.583">minute</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="walking" newWord="sister" score="0.933">sister</span>; if the first, I would be completely in your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.239" formerWord="fire" newWord="self" score="0.239">self</span>."

Mrs. Bennet sent them <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> that they could not possibly have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> before Tuesday; and in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>postscript</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.611" formerWord="postscript" newWord="nobody" score="0.611">nobody</span> it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.

Mr. Collins was eloquent in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span>.

<p>"You <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.965" formerWord="judge" newWord="friend" score="0.965">friend</span> very properly,"said Mr. Bennet,"and it is happy for you that you possess the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>talent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.233" formerWord="talent" newWord="debasement" score="0.233">debasement</span> of flattering with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delicacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.4" formerWord="delicacy" newWord="something" score="0.4">something</span>.

Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.

Lydia gaped as he opened the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>volume</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="volume" newWord="house" score="0.857">house</span>, and before he had, with very monotonous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>solemnity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="solemnity" newWord="return" score="0.776">return</span>, read three pages, she interrupted him with:

My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> told me so herself on Saturday.

Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span>, however, was unexpectedly relieved.

<p>Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

<p>"As much as I ever wish to be,"cried Elizabeth very warmly."I have spent four days in the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> with him, and I think him very disagreeable."

Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no."
<p>"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>history</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="history" newWord="family" score="0.846">family</span> of himself as he gave me last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>night</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.946" formerWord="night" newWord="life" score="0.946">life</span>; names, facts, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="everything" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> mentioned without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ceremony</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.539" formerWord="ceremony" newWord="curiosity" score="0.539">curiosity</span>.

<p>But Jane could think with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>certainty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="certainty" newWord="family" score="0.846">family</span> on only one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> - - that Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.942" formerWord="affair" newWord="friend" score="0.942">friend</span> became public.

Such very superior <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dancing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="dancing" newWord="brother" score="0.962">brother</span> is not often seen.

<p>"I do not think we were speaking at all.

<p>"What think you of books?"said he, smiling. 
<p>"Books - - oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."
<p>"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>, there can at least be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="want" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span>.

<p>"Yes, always,"she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span>, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming,"I remember <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hearing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="hearing" newWord="time" score="0.955">time</span> you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resentment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.386" formerWord="resentment" newWord="papa" score="0.386">papa</span> once created was unappeasable.

<p>"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> quite forgot to tell you, among his other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>communication</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="communication" newWord="friend" score="0.93">friend</span>, that he was the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>son</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="son" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>steward</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="steward" newWord="sister" score="0.85">sister</span>. Let me recommend you, however, as a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, not to give implicit <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confidence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.877" formerWord="confidence" newWord="heart" score="0.877">heart</span> to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ill</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="ill" newWord="son" score="0.95">son</span>, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span> thought that he could not well avoid including him in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="invitation" newWord="aunt" score="0.96">aunt</span> to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>. His coming into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span> at all is a most insolent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.

<p>After <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="influence" score="0.725">influence</span>, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lament</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.293" formerWord="lament" newWord="downstairs" score="0.293">downstairs</span> over his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>absence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="absence" newWord="minute" score="0.86">minute</span> from the Netherfield <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span>.

<p>Soon after their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield.

<p>"I see what you are feeling,"replied Charlotte."You must be surprised, very much surprised - - so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.

Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.

<p>Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span>, now put herself forward to confirm his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.991">family</span>, by mentioning her prior <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>knowledge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.872" formerWord="knowledge" newWord="pleasure" score="0.872">pleasure</span> of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>stop</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.218" formerWord="stop" newWord="compromise" score="0.218">compromise</span> to the exclamations of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> and sisters by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>earnestness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.255" formerWord="earnestness" newWord="xxxiv" score="0.255">xxxiv</span> of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>variety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.67" formerWord="variety" newWord="character" score="0.67">character</span> of remarks on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> that might be expected from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span>, the excellent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> of Mr. Collins, and the convenient <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.498" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.498">nature</span> of Hunsford from London.

In the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>, she persisted in disbelieving the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span>; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span> might be broken off.

<p>Mr. Collins's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> into Hertfordshire was no longer a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="husband" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> while her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>health</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="health" newWord="pleasure" score="0.937">pleasure</span> was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> only to the greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="distress" newWord="friend" score="0.96">friend</span> of Mr. Bingley's continued <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>absence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="absence" newWord="minute" score="0.86">minute</span>. 
<p>Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span>. Day after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>report</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.554" formerWord="report" newWord="intimacy" score="0.554">intimacy</span> which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>winter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.483" formerWord="winter" newWord="mind" score="0.483">mind</span>; a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>report</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.554" formerWord="report" newWord="intimacy" score="0.554">intimacy</span> which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>falsehood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.244" formerWord="falsehood" newWord="hyacinth" score="0.244">hyacinth</span>. 
<p>Even Elizabeth began to fear - - not that Bingley was indifferent - - but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> so destructive of Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, and so dishonorable to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>stability</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.261" formerWord="stability" newWord="ankle" score="0.261">ankle</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lover</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="lover" newWord="return" score="0.676">return</span>, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>strength</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="strength" newWord="happiness" score="0.924">happiness</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.684" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.684">deal</span>. 
<p>As for Jane, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anxiety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.898" formerWord="anxiety" newWord="life" score="0.898">life</span> under this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suspense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.572" formerWord="suspense" newWord="selfishness" score="0.572">selfishness</span> was, of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span>, more painful than Elizabeth ' s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span> was never alluded to. But as no such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delicacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.4" formerWord="delicacy" newWord="something" score="0.4">something</span> restrained her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>, an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.679">mile</span> seldom passed in which she did not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>talk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="talk" newWord="happiness" score="0.933">happiness</span> of Bingley, express her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impatience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.448" formerWord="impatience" newWord="felicity" score="0.448">felicity</span> for his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span>, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's steady <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mildness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.223" formerWord="mildness" newWord="mouth" score="0.223">mouth</span> to bear these attacks with tolerable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tranquillity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.408" formerWord="tranquillity" newWord="melancholy" score="0.408">melancholy</span>. 
<p>Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.96">affection</span>, but his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reception</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.346" formerWord="reception" newWord="plain" score="0.346">plain</span> at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="family" score="0.971">Family</span> was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>introduction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.514" formerWord="introduction" newWord="note" score="0.514">note</span>. He was too happy, however, to need much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span>; and luckily for the others, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> of love-making relieved them from a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="company" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>.

<p>Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>state</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="state" newWord="friend" score="0.972">friend</span>. The very mention of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> concerning the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span> threw her into an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>agony</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.599" formerWord="agony" newWord="minute" score="0.599">minute</span> of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.308" formerWord="sight" newWord="pleasanter" score="0.308">pleasanter</span> of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, she regarded her with jealous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abhorrence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.454" formerWord="abhorrence" newWord="dirt" score="0.454">dirt</span>. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.679">mile</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>possession</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.275" formerWord="possession" newWord="retirement" score="0.275">retirement</span>; and whenever she spoke in a low <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>voice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="voice" newWord="brother" score="0.984">brother</span> to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>estate</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.87" formerWord="estate" newWord="woman" score="0.87">woman</span>, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="husband" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>. 
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"said she,"it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="mistress" newWord="woman" score="0.807">woman</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, that I should be forced to make <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> for her, and live to see her take her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> in it!"
<p>"My dear, do not give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."
<p>This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, she went on as before. 
<p>"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>estate</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.87" formerWord="estate" newWord="woman" score="0.87">woman</span>. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it."
<p>"What should not you mind?"
<p>"I should not mind <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> at all."
<p>"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>state</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="state" newWord="friend" score="0.972">friend</span> of such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>insensibility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.403" formerWord="insensibility" newWord="danger" score="0.403">danger</span>."
<p>"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> about the entail.

<p>"I leave it to yourself to determine,"said Mr. Bennet.

<p>After a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> spent in professions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> and schemes of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>felicity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.883" formerWord="felicity" newWord="brother" score="0.883">brother</span>, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> of Saturday. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pain</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="pain" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>separation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="separation" newWord="company" score="0.866">company</span>, however, might be alleviated on his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>, by preparations for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reception</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.346" formerWord="reception" newWord="plain" score="0.346">plain</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>bride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.72" formerWord="bride" newWord="mother" score="0.72">mother</span>; as he had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> to hope, that shortly after his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> into Hertfordshire, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>leave</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.931" formerWord="leave" newWord="friend" score="0.931">friend</span> of his relations at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="family" score="0.971">Family</span> with as much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>solemnity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="solemnity" newWord="return" score="0.776">return</span> as before; wished his fair cousins <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>health</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="health" newWord="pleasure" score="0.937">pleasure</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> again, and promised their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> of thanks. 
<p>On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> of receiving her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span> and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span>, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="sensible" newWord="conversation" score="0.798">conversation</span>, gentlemanlike <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, greatly superior to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, as well by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.94" formerWord="nature" newWord="time" score="0.94">time</span> as <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>education</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.787" formerWord="education" newWord="hearing" score="0.787">hearing</span>. The Netherfield ladies would have had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>difficulty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="difficulty" newWord="home" score="0.903">home</span> in believing that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> who lived by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trade</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.326" formerWord="trade" newWord="avoidance" score="0.326">avoidance</span>, and within <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.375" formerWord="view" newWord="dirt" score="0.375">dirt</span> of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>, and a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favourite</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.321" formerWord="favourite" newWord="lasting" score="0.321">lasting</span> with all her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="family" score="0.971">Family</span> nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span>. They had frequently been staying with her in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>. 
<p>The first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> of Mrs. Gardiner's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> on her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. Two of her girls had been upon the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, and after all there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> in it. 
<p>"I do not blame Jane,"she continued,"for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span> by this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, had it not been for her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>perverseness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.477" formerWord="perverseness" newWord="look" score="0.477">look</span>. He made her an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>offer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.771" formerWord="offer" newWord="attempt" score="0.771">attempt</span> in this very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>, and she refused him. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consequence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="consequence" newWord="situation" score="0.902">situation</span> of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> married before I have, and that the Longbourn <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>estate</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.87" formerWord="estate" newWord="woman" score="0.87">woman</span> is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.969">way</span> else. However, your coming just at this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."
<p>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="chief" newWord="day" score="0.922">day</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>news</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="news" newWord="brother" score="0.977">brother</span> had been given before, in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> of Jane and Elizabeth's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>correspondence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.246" formerWord="correspondence" newWord="entree" score="0.246">entree</span> with her, made her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> a slight <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="compassion" newWord="family" score="0.961">family</span> to her nieces, turned the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span>. 
<p>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span>."It seems likely to have been a desirable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span> for Jane,"said she."I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with a pretty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> for a few weeks, and when <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accident</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="accident" newWord="point" score="0.679">point</span> separates them, so easily forgets her, that these <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="sort" newWord="man" score="0.976">man</span> of inconsistencies are very frequent."
<p>"An excellent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consolation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="consolation" newWord="money" score="0.853">money</span> in its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>,"said Elizabeth,"but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accident</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="accident" newWord="point" score="0.679">point</span>. It does not often happen that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="interference" newWord="man" score="0.789">man</span> of friends will persuade a young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> of independent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> to think no more of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> whom he was violently in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with only a few days before."
<p>"But that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="expression" newWord="woman" score="0.794">woman</span> of ' violently in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> ' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span>. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half-hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.532" formerWord="half-hour" newWord="partner" score="0.532">partner</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="time" score="0.974">time</span>, as to a real, strong <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.684" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.684">deal</span>. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley's love?"
<p>"I never saw a more promising <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="inclination" newWord="mother" score="0.758">mother</span>; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ball</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="ball" newWord="friend" score="0.985">friend</span> he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="dance" newWord="answer" score="0.902">answer</span>; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>incivility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.276" formerWord="incivility" newWord="feebleness" score="0.276">feebleness</span> the very essence of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span>?"
<p>"Oh, yes! - - of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disposition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="disposition" newWord="minute" score="0.799">minute</span>, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scene</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.934" formerWord="scene" newWord="affection" score="0.934">affection</span> might be of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>service</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="service" newWord="time" score="0.851">time</span> - - and perhaps a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.698" formerWord="relief" newWord="expectation" score="0.698">expectation</span> from <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> may be as useful as <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>."
<p>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proposal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.263" formerWord="proposal" newWord="dream" score="0.263">dream</span>, and felt persuaded of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s ready <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquiescence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.239" formerWord="acquiescence" newWord="make" score="0.239">make</span>. 
<p>"I hope,"added Mrs. Gardiner,"that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.914" formerWord="consideration" newWord="affection" score="0.914">affection</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span> to this young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> will influence her. We live in so different a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."
<p>"And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> of London! My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>month</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.406" formerWord="month" newWord="reason" score="0.406">reason</span>'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him."
<p>"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>? She will not be able to help calling."

<p>Mrs. Gardiner's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>caution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="caution" newWord="anything" score="0.933">anything</span> to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: 
<p>"You are too sensible a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span>, Lizzy, to fall in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> openly.

I have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> to say against him; he is a most interesting young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>; and if he had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fancy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="fancy" newWord="family" score="0.949">family</span> run away with you. You have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="sense" newWord="man" score="0.978">man</span>, and we all expect you to use it. Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> would depend on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resolution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.895" formerWord="resolution" newWord="life" score="0.895">life</span> and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="conduct" newWord="kind" score="0.943">kind</span>, I am sure. You must not disappoint your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span>."
<p>"My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, this is being serious indeed."
<p>"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
<p>"Well, then, you need not be under any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alarm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="alarm" newWord="sister" score="0.966">sister</span>.

<p>"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
<p>"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>comparison</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.542" formerWord="comparison" newWord="spirit" score="0.542">spirit</span>, the most agreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> I ever saw - - and if he becomes really attached to me - - I believe it will be better that he should not.

Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy!

My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span>, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> that where there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, young people are seldom withheld by immediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="want" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fellow-creatures</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.31" formerWord="fellow-creatures" newWord="disgust" score="0.31">disgust</span> if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wisdom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.233" formerWord="wisdom" newWord="yarmouth" score="0.233">yarmouth</span> to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hurry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="hurry" newWord="girl" score="0.777">girl</span>. I will not be in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hurry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="hurry" newWord="girl" score="0.777">girl</span> to believe myself his first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span>. When I am in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="company" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best."
<p>"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> of inviting him."
<p>"As I did the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>,"said Elizabeth with a conscious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>:"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.991">family</span> that he has been so frequently invited this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span>.

But really, and upon my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span>, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."

<p>Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abode</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="abode" newWord="minute" score="0.817">minute</span> with the Lucases, his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> was no great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inconvenience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.911" formerWord="inconvenience" newWord="affection" score="0.911">affection</span> to Mrs. Bennet.

<p>She wrote again when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span> was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley."I did not think Caroline in spirits,"were her words,"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="notice" newWord="her" score="0.937">her</span> of my coming to London.

<p>Mrs. Gardiner about this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> reminded Elizabeth of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>promise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.894" formerWord="promise" newWord="time" score="0.894">time</span> concerning that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.912">marriage</span>, and required <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="information" newWord="situation" score="0.86">situation</span>; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>contentment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.436" formerWord="contentment" newWord="discussion" score="0.436">discussion</span> to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> than to herself.

<p>All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:"I am now convinced, my dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, that I have never been much in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span>; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>passion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.904" formerWord="passion" newWord="aunt" score="0.904">aunt</span>, I should at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>present</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="present" newWord="brother" score="0.959">brother</span> detest his very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="name" newWord="family" score="0.971">family</span>, and wish him all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evil</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="evil" newWord="letter" score="0.962">letter</span>.

<p>"But he paid her not the smallest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> till her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>grandfather</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.233" formerWord="grandfather" newWord="fan" score="0.233">fan</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>death</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.565" formerWord="death" newWord="minute" score="0.565">minute</span> made her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="mistress" newWord="woman" score="0.807">woman</span> of this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span>."
<p>"No - - why should he?

If she does not object to it, why should we?"
<p>"Her not objecting does not justify him.

<p>"Well,"cried Elizabeth,"have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."
<p>"No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose.

<p>"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in."

<p>"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."
<p>"Aye, no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span>; but that is what a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>governess</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.253" formerWord="governess" newWord="animal" score="0.253">animal</span> will prevent, and if I had known your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.

<p>His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> within <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.375" formerWord="view" newWord="dirt" score="0.375">dirt</span> of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>order</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="order" newWord="way" score="0.909">way</span> to have the earliest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assurance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="assurance" newWord="heart" score="0.882">heart</span> of it, and after making his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>bow</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.332" formerWord="bow" newWord="relationship" score="0.332">relationship</span> as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> turned into the Park, hurried <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> with the great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="character" score="0.866">character</span>. On the following <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>son</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="son" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> Lord - - - -, and, to the great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> of all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.

<p>Elizabeth had scarcely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> to disclaim all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>right</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.843" formerWord="right" newWord="nothing" score="0.843">nothing</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compliment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="compliment" newWord="day" score="0.889">day</span>, before their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>approach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.761" formerWord="approach" newWord="country" score="0.761">country</span> was announced by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door-bell</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.472" formerWord="door-bell" newWord="minute" score="0.472">minute</span>, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, was about thirty, not handsome, but in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span> and address most truly the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.912">marriage</span>. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire - - paid his compliments, with his usual <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.385" formerWord="reserve" newWord="weather" score="0.385">weather</span>, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, met her with every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>appearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="appearance" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>composure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.776" formerWord="composure" newWord="minute" score="0.776">minute</span>.

<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> directly with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>readiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="readiness" newWord="engagement" score="0.846">engagement</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="ease" newWord="friend" score="0.971">friend</span> of a well-bred <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, and talked very pleasantly; but his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="cousin" newWord="happiness" score="0.967">happiness</span>, after having addressed a slight <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.85">minute</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>garden</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.585" formerWord="garden" newWord="lock" score="0.585">lock</span> to Mrs. Collins, sat for some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.969">way</span>.

<p>She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consciousness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="consciousness" newWord="horror" score="0.795">horror</span> of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.

<p>Chapter 31 
<p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="invitation" newWord="aunt" score="0.96">aunt</span> thither - - for while there were visitors in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> after the gentlemen's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span>, that they were honoured by such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span>, and then they were merely asked on leaving <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.487" formerWord="church" newWord="visit" score="0.487">visit</span> to come there in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>. For the last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span>. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.487" formerWord="church" newWord="visit" score="0.487">visit</span>. 
<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="invitation" newWord="aunt" score="0.96">aunt</span> was accepted of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span>, and at a proper <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.679">mile</span> they joined the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span> in Lady Catherine's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drawing-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="drawing-room" newWord="room" score="0.707">room</span>. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="family" score="0.907">family</span> received them civilly, but it was plain that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="company" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> was by no means so acceptable as when she could get <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="nobody" newWord="family" score="0.938">family</span> else; and she was, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fact</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.815" formerWord="fact" newWord="woman" score="0.815">woman</span>, almost engrossed by her nephews, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>. 
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> was a welcome <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.698" formerWord="relief" newWord="expectation" score="0.698">expectation</span> to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>, of new books and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>music</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="music" newWord="wish" score="0.909">wish</span>, that Elizabeth had never been <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.77" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.77">minute</span> so well entertained in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span> before; and they conversed with so much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>spirit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="spirit" newWord="day" score="0.952">day</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>flow</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.318" formerWord="flow" newWord="horror" score="0.318">horror</span>, as to draw the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>look</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.925" formerWord="look" newWord="nothing" score="0.925">nothing</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span>; and that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="family" score="0.907">family</span>, after a while, shared the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>feeling</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="feeling" newWord="time" score="0.979">time</span>, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out: 
<p>"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."
<p>"We are <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>music</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="music" newWord="wish" score="0.909">wish</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>madam</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.699" formerWord="madam" newWord="year" score="0.699">year</span>,"said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.

<p>Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proficiency</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.278" formerWord="proficiency" newWord="quest" score="0.278">quest</span>.

<p>"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>state</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="state" newWord="friend" score="0.972">friend</span> to hear me?

<p>"I shall not say you are mistaken,"he replied,"because you could not really believe me to entertain any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.429" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.429">wife</span> of alarming you; and I have had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="time" score="0.974">time</span> long enough to know that you find great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>enjoyment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="enjoyment" newWord="heart" score="0.922">heart</span> in occasionally professing opinions which in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fact</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.815" formerWord="fact" newWord="woman" score="0.815">woman</span> are not your own."
<p>Elizabeth laughed heartily at this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>picture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="picture" newWord="honour" score="0.846">honour</span> of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam,"Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="cousin" newWord="happiness" score="0.967">happiness</span> will give you a very pretty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.312" formerWord="notion" newWord="intermission" score="0.312">intermission</span> of me, and teach you not to believe a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> I say.

<p>"I am not afraid of you,"said he, smilingly. 
<p>"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,"cried Colonel Fitzwilliam."I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."
<p>"You shall hear then - - but prepare yourself for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> very dreadful.

<p>"I had not at that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span> of knowing any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assembly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.441" formerWord="assembly" newWord="horror" score="0.441">horror</span> beyond my own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>."

<p>"Perhaps,"said Darcy,"I should have judged better, had I sought an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>introduction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.514" formerWord="introduction" newWord="note" score="0.514">note</span>; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."

<p>"I can answer your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.962">time</span>,"said Fitzwilliam,"without applying to him.

<p>"My fingers,"said Elizabeth,"do not move over this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instrument</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.594" formerWord="instrument" newWord="case" score="0.594">case</span> in the masterly <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> which I see so many women's do.

<p>Darcy smiled and said,"You are perfectly right. You have employed your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> much better.

We neither of us perform to strangers."
<p>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: 
<p>"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.583" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.583">minute</span> of a London <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span>.

<p>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="cousin" newWord="happiness" score="0.967">happiness</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span>; but neither at that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> nor at any other could she discern any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>symptom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.274" formerWord="symptom" newWord="shop" score="0.274">shop</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span>; and from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> to Miss de Bourgh she derived this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>comfort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.892" formerWord="comfort" newWord="day" score="0.892">day</span> for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.516" formerWord="relation" newWord="park" score="0.516">park</span>.

<p>Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>writing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.628" formerWord="writing" newWord="cause" score="0.628">cause</span> to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>village</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="village" newWord="heart" score="0.893">heart</span>, when she was startled by a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.599" formerWord="ring" newWord="justice" score="0.599">justice</span> at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.978">time</span>, the certain <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>signal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.36" formerWord="signal" newWord="ingenuity" score="0.36">ingenuity</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.409" formerWord="visitor" newWord="attendance" score="0.409">attendance</span>. As she had heard no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span>, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>apprehension</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.572" formerWord="apprehension" newWord="glance" score="0.572">glance</span> was putting away her half-finished <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.978">time</span> opened, and, to her very great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>. 
<p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intrusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.247" formerWord="intrusion" newWord="revenge" score="0.247">revenge</span> by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within. 
<p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>danger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.945" formerWord="danger" newWord="family" score="0.945">family</span> of sinking into total <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.956" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.956">sister</span>. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span>, and in this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>emergence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.274" formerWord="emergence" newWord="square" score="0.274">square</span> recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span> of their hasty <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>departure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="departure" newWord="news" score="0.808">news</span>, she observed: 
<p>"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?"
<p>"Perfectly so, I thank you."
<p>She found that she was to receive no other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and, after a short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.649" formerWord="pause" newWord="word" score="0.649">word</span> added: 
<p>"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> of ever returning to Netherfield again?"
<p>"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> there in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>future</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="future" newWord="aunt" score="0.943">aunt</span>. He has many friends, and is at a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="life" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> when friends and engagements are continually increasing."
<p>"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.675">duty</span> that he should give up the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> so much for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>convenience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.915" formerWord="convenience" newWord="family" score="0.915">family</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.675">duty</span> as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>principle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.858" formerWord="principle" newWord="town" score="0.858">town</span>."
<p>"I should not be surprised,"said Darcy,"if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purchase</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.306" formerWord="purchase" newWord="dining" score="0.306">dining</span> offers."
<p>Elizabeth made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>. She was afraid of talking longer of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>; and, having <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> else to say, was now determined to leave the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trouble</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.957" formerWord="trouble" newWord="friend" score="0.957">friend</span> of finding a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span> to him. 
<p>He took the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hint</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.728" formerWord="hint" newWord="town" score="0.728">town</span>, and soon began with,"This seems a very comfortable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."
<p>"I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kindness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="kindness" newWord="brother" score="0.973">brother</span> on a more grateful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span>."
<p>"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>choice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="choice" newWord="happiness" score="0.949">happiness</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span>."
<p>"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sensible</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.798" formerWord="sensible" newWord="conversation" score="0.798">conversation</span> women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> has an excellent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>understanding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.721" formerWord="understanding" newWord="dinner" score="0.721">dinner</span> - - though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>light</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.302" formerWord="light" newWord="composure" score="0.302">composure</span> it is certainly a very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span> for her."
<p>"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.498" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.498">nature</span> of her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> and friends."
<p>"An easy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.498" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.498">nature</span>, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."
<p>"And what is fifty miles of good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>road</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="road" newWord="deal" score="0.796">deal</span>? Little more than half a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>journey</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="journey" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span>. Yes, I call it a very easy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.498" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.498">nature</span>."
<p>"I should never have considered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.498" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.498">nature</span> as one of the advantages of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span>,"cried Elizabeth."I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>."
<p>"It is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proof</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="proof" newWord="nothing" score="0.855">nothing</span> of your own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.684" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.684">deal</span> to Hertfordshire. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="Anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">Time</span> beyond the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.675">duty</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Longbourn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="Longbourn" newWord="family" score="0.971">Family</span>, I suppose, would appear far."
<p>As he spoke there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="sort" newWord="man" score="0.976">man</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span> which Elizabeth fancied she <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>understood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.788" formerWord="understood" newWord="life" score="0.788">life</span>; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered: 
<p>"I do not mean to say that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> may not be settled too near her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>. The far and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>near</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.385" formerWord="near" newWord="perfection" score="0.385">perfection</span> must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.498" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.498">nature</span> becomes no evil. But that is not the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span> here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>income</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="income" newWord="time" score="0.855">time</span>, but not such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> as will allow of frequent journeys - - and I am persuaded my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> would not call herself near her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> under less than half the present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.498" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.498">nature</span>."
<p>Mr. Darcy drew his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="chair" newWord="haste" score="0.793">haste</span> a little towards her, and said,"You cannot have a right to such very strong local <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.684" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.684">deal</span>. You cannot have been always at Longbourn."
<p>Elizabeth looked surprised. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.912">marriage</span> experienced some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>change</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="change" newWord="brother" score="0.976">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>feeling</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="feeling" newWord="time" score="0.979">time</span>; he drew back his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="chair" newWord="haste" score="0.793">haste</span>, took a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>newspaper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.637" formerWord="newspaper" newWord="scene" score="0.637">scene</span> from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.548" formerWord="table" newWord="morning" score="0.548">morning</span>, and glancing over it, said, in a colder <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>voice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="voice" newWord="brother" score="0.984">brother</span>: 
<p>"Are you pleased with Kent?"
<p>A short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dialogue</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.492" formerWord="dialogue" newWord="work" score="0.492">work</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span> ensued, on either <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>calm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.318" formerWord="calm" newWord="occupation" score="0.318">occupation</span> and concise - - and soon put an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="end" newWord="time" score="0.984">time</span> to by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>entrance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.915" formerWord="entrance" newWord="week" score="0.915">week</span> of Charlotte and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, just returned from her walk. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tete-a-tete</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.322" formerWord="tete-a-tete" newWord="ingenuity" score="0.322">ingenuity</span> surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mistake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="mistake" newWord="time" score="0.949">time</span> which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.969">way</span>, went away. 
<p>"What can be the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meaning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="meaning" newWord="day" score="0.796">day</span> of this?"said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone."My dear, Eliza, he must be in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>."
<p>But when Elizabeth told of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.956" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.956">sister</span>; it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span> to proceed from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>difficulty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="difficulty" newWord="home" score="0.903">home</span> of finding <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> to do, which was the more probable from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>.

<p>But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>society</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="society" newWord="time" score="0.979">time</span>, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speak</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.342" formerWord="speak" newWord="something" score="0.342">something</span>, it seemed the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>effect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="effect" newWord="sister" score="0.961">sister</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>necessity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="necessity" newWord="happiness" score="0.966">happiness</span> rather than of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>choice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="choice" newWord="happiness" score="0.949">happiness</span> - - a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sacrifice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.232" formerWord="sacrifice" newWord="g" score="0.232">g</span> to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>propriety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="propriety" newWord="none" score="0.837">none</span>, not a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to himself.

<p>Chapter 33

<p>More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>park</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.845" formerWord="park" newWord="minute" score="0.845">minute</span>, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.

How it could occur a second <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, therefore, was very odd!

He never said a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, nor did she give herself the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trouble</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.957" formerWord="trouble" newWord="friend" score="0.957">friend</span> of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> in being at Hunsford, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> of solitary walks, and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span> of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>; and that in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>, he must mean an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>allusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.332" formerWord="allusion" newWord="haste" score="0.332">haste</span> to what might arise in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>quarter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.24" formerWord="quarter" newWord="ingenuousness" score="0.24">ingenuousness</span>.

<p>She was engaged one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> as she walked, in perusing Jane's last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dwelling</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.784" formerWord="dwelling" newWord="family" score="0.784">family</span> on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> immediately and forcing a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>, she said:

<p>And accordingly she did <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>turn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.281" formerWord="turn" newWord="control" score="0.281">control</span>, and they walked towards the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Parsonage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.223" formerWord="Parsonage" newWord="villain" score="0.223">Villain</span> together. 
<p>"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"said she. 
<p>"Yes - - if Darcy does not put it off again.

<p>"No,"said Colonel Fitzwilliam,"that is an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.583" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.583">minute</span> which he must divide with me.

<p>As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uneasiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.229" formerWord="uneasiness" newWord="disquiet" score="0.229">disquiet</span>, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span>. She directly replied:

<p>"Oh! yes,"said Elizabeth <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drily</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.294" formerWord="drily" newWord="midst" score="0.294">midst</span>;"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>care</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="care" newWord="affection" score="0.903">affection</span> of him."
<p>"Care of him!

But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span> meant.

<p>"It is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>circumstance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="circumstance" newWord="thing" score="0.973">thing</span> which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="round" newWord="minute" score="0.875">minute</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, it would be an unpleasant <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>."
<p>"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."
<p>"And remember that I have not much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> from the inconveniences of a most imprudent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> of young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> to get into a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scrape</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.522" formerWord="scrape" newWord="difference" score="0.522">difference</span> of that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="sort" newWord="man" score="0.976">man</span>, and from knowing them to have been together the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>summer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.27" formerWord="summer" newWord="exposure" score="0.27">exposure</span>."
<p>"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="interference" newWord="man" score="0.789">man</span>?"
<p>"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span>."
<p>"And what arts did he use to separate them?"
<p>"He did not talk to me of his own arts,"said Fitzwilliam, smiling."He only told me what I have now told you."
<p>Elizabeth made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and walked on, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>heart</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="heart" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> swelling with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indignation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="indignation" newWord="anything" score="0.908">anything</span>. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful. 
<p>"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,"said she."Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="cousin" newWord="happiness" score="0.967">happiness</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="conduct" newWord="kind" score="0.943">kind</span> does not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="suit" newWord="happiness" score="0.882">happiness</span> my feelings.

<p>"You are rather disposed to call his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.789" formerWord="interference" newWord="man" score="0.789">man</span> officious?"
<p>"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>propriety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="propriety" newWord="none" score="0.837">none</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inclination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.758" formerWord="inclination" newWord="mother" score="0.758">mother</span>, or why, upon his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judgement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.797" formerWord="judgement" newWord="son" score="0.797">son</span> alone, he was to determine and direct in what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> was to be happy. But,"she continued, recollecting herself,"as we know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="none" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.

<p>"That is not an unnatural surmise,"said Fitzwilliam,"but it is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lessening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.42" formerWord="lessening" newWord="readiness" score="0.42">readiness</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span> of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cousin</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="cousin" newWord="happiness" score="0.967">happiness</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>triumph</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.284" formerWord="triumph" newWord="self-denying" score="0.284">self-denying</span> very sadly."
<p>This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>picture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="picture" newWord="honour" score="0.846">honour</span> of Mr. Darcy, that she would not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trust</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.915" formerWord="trust" newWord="man" score="0.915">man</span> herself with an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and therefore, abruptly changing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.

That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.429" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.429">wife</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrangement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.715" formerWord="arrangement" newWord="note" score="0.715">note</span> of them.

<p>When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>employment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.916" formerWord="employment" newWord="answer" score="0.916">answer</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>examination</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.228" formerWord="examination" newWord="copse" score="0.228">copse</span> of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.

<p>While settling this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span>, she was suddenly roused by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sound</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="sound" newWord="object" score="0.726">object</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door-bell</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.472" formerWord="door-bell" newWord="minute" score="0.472">minute</span>, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.

<p>The two gentlemen left Rosings the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>, and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> the pleasing <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="character" score="0.866">character</span>, of their appearing in very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>health</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="health" newWord="pleasure" score="0.937">pleasure</span>, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>melancholy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="melancholy" newWord="heart" score="0.917">heart</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scene</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.934" formerWord="scene" newWord="affection" score="0.934">affection</span> so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span>; and on his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> brought back, with great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>satisfaction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="satisfaction" newWord="affection" score="0.944">affection</span>, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>message</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.836" formerWord="message" newWord="worth" score="0.836">worth</span> from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="family" score="0.907">family</span>, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her. 
<p>Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> have been presented to her as her future <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="niece" newWord="love" score="0.853">love</span>; nor could she think, without a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>, of what her ladyship's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indignation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="indignation" newWord="anything" score="0.908">anything</span> would have been."What would she have said? how would she have behaved?"were questions with which she amused herself. 
<p>Their first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span> was the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>diminution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.27" formerWord="diminution" newWord="self" score="0.27">self</span> of the Rosings <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>."I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,"said Lady Catherine;"I believe no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> feels the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>loss</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="loss" newWord="brother" score="0.969">brother</span> of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.684" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.684">deal</span> to Rosings certainly increases."
<p>Mr. Collins had a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compliment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="compliment" newWord="day" score="0.889">day</span>, and an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>allusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.332" formerWord="allusion" newWord="haste" score="0.332">haste</span> to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span>. 
<p>Lady Catherine observed, after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="dinner" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accounting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.237" formerWord="accounting" newWord="avowal" score="0.237">avowal</span> for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> again so soon, she added: 
<p>"But if that is the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>, you must write to your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> and beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>company</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="company" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, I am sure."
<p>"I am much obliged to your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ladyship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.907" formerWord="ladyship" newWord="family" score="0.907">family</span> for your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>invitation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="invitation" newWord="aunt" score="0.96">aunt</span>,"replied Elizabeth,"but it is not in my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>power</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.887" formerWord="power" newWord="nothing" score="0.887">nothing</span> to accept it. I must be in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> next Saturday."
<p>"Why, at that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rate</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.368" formerWord="rate" newWord="absence" score="0.368">absence</span>, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="occasion" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span> for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.96">affection</span>."
<p>"But my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> cannot. He wrote last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> to hurry my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>."
<p>"Oh! your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> may spare you, if your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> can. Daughters are never of so much <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consequence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="consequence" newWord="situation" score="0.902">situation</span> to a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span>. And if you will stay another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>month</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.406" formerWord="month" newWord="reason" score="0.406">reason</span> complete, it will be in my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>power</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.887" formerWord="power" newWord="nothing" score="0.887">nothing</span> to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span>; and as Dawson does not object to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>barouche-box</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.258" formerWord="barouche-box" newWord="soliloquy" score="0.258">soliloquy</span>, there will be very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span> for one of you - - and indeed, if the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>weather</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.954" formerWord="weather" newWord="sister" score="0.954">sister</span> should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."
<p>"You are all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kindness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="kindness" newWord="brother" score="0.973">brother</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>madam</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.699" formerWord="madam" newWord="year" score="0.699">year</span>; but I believe we must abide by our original <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>plan</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.79" formerWord="plan" newWord="pleasure" score="0.79">pleasure</span>."
<p>Lady Catherine seemed resigned."Mrs. Collins, you must send a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>servant</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.608" formerWord="servant" newWord="word" score="0.608">word</span> with them. You know I always speak my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="mind" newWord="man" score="0.951">man</span>, and I cannot bear the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> of two young women travelling <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>post</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.838" formerWord="post" newWord="voice" score="0.838">voice</span> by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>somebody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.649" formerWord="somebody" newWord="yesterday" score="0.649">yesterday</span>. I have the greatest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dislike</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="dislike" newWord="man" score="0.897">man</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span> to that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sort</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="sort" newWord="man" score="0.976">man</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span> in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="life" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>. When my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="niece" newWord="love" score="0.853">love</span> Georgiana went to Ramsgate last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>summer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.27" formerWord="summer" newWord="exposure" score="0.27">exposure</span>, I made a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>propriety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="propriety" newWord="none" score="0.837">none</span> in a different <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone."
<p>"My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> is to send a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>servant</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.608" formerWord="servant" newWord="word" score="0.608">word</span> for us."
<p>"Oh! Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span>! He keeps a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man-servant</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.459" formerWord="man-servant" newWord="number" score="0.459">number</span>, does he? I am very glad you have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>somebody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.649" formerWord="somebody" newWord="yesterday" score="0.649">yesterday</span> who thinks of these things.

Bromley, of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span>. If you mention my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="name" newWord="family" score="0.971">family</span> at the Bell, you will be attended to."
<p>Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>journey</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="journey" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span>, and as she did not answer them all herself, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="mind" newWord="man" score="0.951">man</span> so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Reflection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.253" formerWord="Reflection" newWord="billiard-room" score="0.253">Billiard-room</span> must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to it as the greatest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.698" formerWord="relief" newWord="expectation" score="0.698">expectation</span>; and not a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> went by without a solitary <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="walk" newWord="friend" score="0.978">friend</span>, in which she might indulge in all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.523" formerWord="delight" newWord="observation" score="0.523">observation</span> of unpleasant recollections.

She studied every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sentence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="sentence" newWord="end" score="0.756">end</span>; and her feelings towards its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>writer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.421" formerWord="writer" newWord="conquest" score="0.421">conquest</span> were at times widely different. When she remembered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>style</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.722" formerWord="style" newWord="love" score="0.722">love</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>address</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.729" formerWord="address" newWord="justice" score="0.729">justice</span>, she was still full of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indignation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="indignation" newWord="anything" score="0.908">anything</span>; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.957" formerWord="anger" newWord="friend" score="0.957">friend</span> was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="compassion" newWord="family" score="0.961">family</span>.

She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>unhappiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.331" formerWord="unhappiness" newWord="concern" score="0.331">concern</span> which her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>refusal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.807" formerWord="refusal" newWord="everything" score="0.807">everything</span> must have given him. 
<p>"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,"said she,"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disappointment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="disappointment" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span>!"
<p>"Indeed,"replied Elizabeth,"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span> for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"
<p>"Blame you! Oh, no."
<p>"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"
<p>"No - - I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."
<p>"But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>."
<p>She then spoke of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, repeating the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.

<p>"This will not do,"said Elizabeth;"you never will be able to make both of them good for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>.

For my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span>, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy ' s; but you shall do as you choose."
<p>It was some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, however, before a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span> could be extorted from Jane. 
<p>"I do not know when I have been more shocked,"said she."Wickham so very bad!

It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so."
<p>"Oh! no, my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regret</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="regret" newWord="family" score="0.972">family</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>compassion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.961" formerWord="compassion" newWord="family" score="0.961">family</span> are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>justice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="justice" newWord="family" score="0.959">family</span>, that I am growing every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> more unconcerned and indifferent.

<p>"Poor Wickham! there is such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="expression" newWord="woman" score="0.794">woman</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>goodness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.297" formerWord="goodness" newWord="space" score="0.297">space</span> in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>countenance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="countenance" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span>! such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>openness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.459" formerWord="openness" newWord="wedding" score="0.459">wedding</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.889" formerWord="gentleness" newWord="brother" score="0.889">brother</span> in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>!"
<p>"There certainly was some great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mismanagement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.241" formerWord="mismanagement" newWord="sufferer" score="0.241">sufferer</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>education</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.787" formerWord="education" newWord="hearing" score="0.787">hearing</span> of those two young men.

<p>"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>appearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="appearance" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span> of it as you used to do."

<p>"Lizzy, when you first read that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, I am sure you could not treat the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span> as you do now."
<p>"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy.

Oh! how I wanted you!"
<p>"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved."
<p>"Certainly.

<p>Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied,"Surely there can be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="occasion" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span> for exposing him so dreadfully.

<p>"That it ought not to be attempted.

<p>"You are quite right.

<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tumult</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.569" formerWord="tumult" newWord="minute" score="0.569">minute</span> of Elizabeth's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="mind" newWord="man" score="0.951">man</span> was allayed by this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span>.

<p>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="niece" newWord="love" score="0.853">love</span> with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>, but Elizabeth could not return it. 
<p>"And that,"said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,"is my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span> - - and very like him.

<p>Mrs. Reynolds <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>respect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="respect" newWord="happiness" score="0.955">happiness</span> for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intimation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.216" formerWord="intimation" newWord="woody" score="0.216">woody</span> of her knowing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span>. 
<p>"Does that young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span> know Mr. Darcy?"
<p>Elizabeth coloured, and said:"A little."
<p>"And do not you think him a very handsome <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.912">marriage</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ma'am</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="ma'am" newWord="family" score="0.966">family</span>?"
<p>"Yes, very handsome."
<p>"I am sure I know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="none" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> so handsome; but in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gallery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.928" formerWord="gallery" newWord="pleasure" score="0.928">pleasure</span> up stairs you will see a finer, larger <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>picture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.846" formerWord="picture" newWord="honour" score="0.846">honour</span> of him than this. This <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span> was my late <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span>'s favourite <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them."
<p>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them. 
<p>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old. 
<p>"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span>?"said Mrs. Gardiner. 
<p>"Oh! yes - - the handsomest young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span> that ever was seen; and so accomplished! - - She plays and sings all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> long.

<p>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="pride" newWord="sister" score="0.973">sister</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.684" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.684">deal</span>, had evidently great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> in talking of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span> and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. 
<p>"Is your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span> much at Pemberley in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>?"
<p>"Not so much as I could wish, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="sir" newWord="brother" score="0.966">brother</span>; but I dare say he may spend <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.77" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.77">minute</span> his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>summer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.27" formerWord="summer" newWord="exposure" score="0.27">exposure</span> months."
<p>"Except,"thought Elizabeth,"when she goes to Ramsgate."
<p>"If your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>master</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.818" formerWord="master" newWord="town" score="0.818">town</span> would marry, you might see more of him."
<p>"Yes, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="sir" newWord="brother" score="0.966">brother</span>; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him."
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,"It is very much to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="credit" newWord="love" score="0.817">love</span>, I am sure, that you should think so."
<p>"I say no more than the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.754" formerWord="everybody" newWord="word" score="0.754">word</span> will say that knows him,"replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>astonishment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.934" formerWord="astonishment" newWord="life" score="0.934">life</span> as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>housekeeper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.651" formerWord="housekeeper" newWord="dirt" score="0.651">dirt</span> added,"I have never known a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cross</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.204" formerWord="cross" newWord="dear" score="0.204">dear</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> from him in my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="life" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."
<p>This was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span>, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.

<p>"Yes, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="sir" newWord="brother" score="0.966">brother</span>, I know I am.

But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>boy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.384" formerWord="boy" newWord="firmness" score="0.384">firmness</span> in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span>."
<p>Elizabeth almost stared at her."Can this be Mr. Darcy?"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thought</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="thought" newWord="life" score="0.922">life</span> she. 
<p>"His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> was an excellent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>,"said Mrs. Gardiner.

<p>Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impatient</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.742" formerWord="impatient" newWord="news" score="0.742">news</span> for more.

His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="time" score="0.974">time</span> with Elizabeth was very trifling."
<p>"To be sure, Lizzy,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>,"he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>countenance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="countenance" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span>, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?"
<p>Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>. 
<p>"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,"replied her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span>."Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span>, as he might change his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="mind" newWord="man" score="0.951">man</span> another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, and warn me off his grounds."
<p>Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span>, but said <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span>. 
<p>"From what we have seen of him,"continued Mrs. Gardiner,"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.969">way</span> as he has done by poor Wickham.

I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.

She was less handsome than her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span>; but there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="sense" newWord="man" score="0.978">man</span> and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.929" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.929">journey</span> in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.255" formerWord="face" newWord="reproach" score="0.255">reproach</span>, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.43" formerWord="observer" newWord="gift" score="0.43">gift</span> as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings. 
<p>They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> to express her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>satisfaction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="satisfaction" newWord="affection" score="0.944">affection</span>, and prepare for such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.409" formerWord="visitor" newWord="attendance" score="0.409">attendance</span>, when Bingley's quick <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="step" newWord="round" score="0.724">round</span> was heard on the stairs, and in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> he entered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>. All Elizabeth's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.957" formerWord="anger" newWord="friend" score="0.957">friend</span> against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ground</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.278" formerWord="ground" newWord="slope" score="0.278">slope</span> against the unaffected <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cordiality</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.478" formerWord="cordiality" newWord="impression" score="0.478">impression</span> with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, after her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done. 
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>personage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.367" formerWord="personage" newWord="evenness" score="0.367">evenness</span> than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span> before them, indeed, excited a lively <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span>. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="niece" newWord="love" score="0.853">love</span> directed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.85">minute</span> towards each with an earnest though guarded <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.683" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="house" score="0.683">house</span>; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conviction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="conviction" newWord="friend" score="0.962">friend</span> that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span>'s sensations they remained a little in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span>; but that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.912">marriage</span> was overflowing with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>admiration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="admiration" newWord="nothing" score="0.893">nothing</span> was evident enough. 
<p>Elizabeth, on her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span>, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="success" newWord="man" score="0.888">man</span>, for those to whom she endeavoured to give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> were prepossessed in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="favour" newWord="time" score="0.976">time</span>. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased. 
<p>In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.312" formerWord="notion" newWord="intermission" score="0.312">intermission</span> that, as he looked at her, he was trying to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.651" formerWord="trace" newWord="minute" score="0.651">minute</span> a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resemblance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="resemblance" newWord="minute" score="0.675">minute</span>. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> that spoke particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regard</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="regard" newWord="family" score="0.953">family</span>. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">Course</span> occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. On this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interpretation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.236" formerWord="interpretation" newWord="fragrance" score="0.236">fragrance</span>, denoted a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>recollection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.229" formerWord="recollection" newWord="delivery" score="0.229">delivery</span> of Jane not untinctured by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tenderness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="tenderness" newWord="day" score="0.791">day</span>, and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="wish" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> of saying more that might lead to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="mention" newWord="sister" score="0.888">sister</span> of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> when the others were talking together, and in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="tone" newWord="sister" score="0.943">sister</span> which had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> of real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regret</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="regret" newWord="family" score="0.972">family</span>, that it"was a very long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> since he had had the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> of seeing her;"and, before she could reply, he added,"It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dancing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="dancing" newWord="brother" score="0.962">brother</span> together at Netherfield."
<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>memory</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.462" formerWord="memory" newWord="deficiency" score="0.462">deficiency</span> so exact; and he afterwards took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="occasion" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span> to ask her, when unattended to by any of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span>, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.962">time</span>, nor in the preceding <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>remark</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.379" formerWord="remark" newWord="ridicule" score="0.379">ridicule</span>; but there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>look</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.925" formerWord="look" newWord="nothing" score="0.925">nothing</span> and a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> which gave them meaning. 
<p>It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>glimpse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.582" formerWord="glimpse" newWord="absence" score="0.582">absence</span>, she saw an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.794" formerWord="expression" newWord="woman" score="0.794">woman</span> of general <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>complaisance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.23" formerWord="complaisance" newWord="cart" score="0.23">cart</span>, and in all that he said she heard an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>accent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.674" formerWord="accent" newWord="period" score="0.674">period</span> so removed from <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hauteur</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.406" formerWord="hauteur" newWord="communication" score="0.406">communication</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disdain</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.402" formerWord="disdain" newWord="park" score="0.402">park</span> of his companions, as convinced <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>her</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="her" newWord="affection" score="0.986">affection</span> that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>improvement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.886" formerWord="improvement" newWord="side" score="0.886">side</span> of manners which she had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>yesterday</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="yesterday" newWord="family" score="0.967">family</span> witnessed however temporary its <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>existence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.587" formerWord="existence" newWord="countenance" score="0.587">countenance</span> might prove, had at least outlived <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>.

<p>On reaching the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, they were shown through the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.29" formerWord="hall" newWord="pelisse" score="0.29">pelisse</span> into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>saloon</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.263" formerWord="saloon" newWord="make" score="0.263">make</span>, whose northern <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aspect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.443" formerWord="aspect" newWord="curiosity" score="0.443">curiosity</span> rendered it delightful for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>summer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.27" formerWord="summer" newWord="exposure" score="0.27">exposure</span>. Its windows opening to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ground</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.278" formerWord="ground" newWord="slope" score="0.278">slope</span>, admitted a most refreshing <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.375" formerWord="view" newWord="dirt" score="0.375">dirt</span> of the high <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.299" formerWord="woody" newWord="furniture" score="0.299">furniture</span> hills behind the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lawn</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.546" formerWord="lawn" newWord="residence" score="0.546">residence</span>. 
<p>In this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span> with whom she lived in London.

<p>By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curtsey</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.312" formerWord="curtsey" newWord="briefly" score="0.312">briefly</span>; and, on their being seated, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.649" formerWord="pause" newWord="word" score="0.649">word</span>, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>, whose <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>endeavour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.35" formerWord="endeavour" newWord="person" score="0.35">person</span> to introduce some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>discourse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.264" formerWord="discourse" newWord="century" score="0.264">century</span> proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>help</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.29" formerWord="help" newWord="duration" score="0.29">duration</span> from Elizabeth, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>courage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.55" formerWord="courage" newWord="thought" score="0.55">thought</span> enough to join in it; and sometimes did <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>venture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.637" formerWord="venture" newWord="doubt" score="0.637">doubt</span> a short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sentence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="sentence" newWord="end" score="0.756">end</span> when there was least <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>danger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.945" formerWord="danger" newWord="family" score="0.945">family</span> of its being heard. 
<p>Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span>, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span>. This <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.85">minute</span> would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.498" formerWord="distance" newWord="nature" score="0.498">nature</span>; but she was not sorry to be spared the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>necessity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="necessity" newWord="happiness" score="0.966">happiness</span> of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> that some of the gentlemen would enter the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>.

<p>While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>appearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.983" formerWord="appearance" newWord="family" score="0.983">family</span> of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>; and then, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>though</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="though" newWord="life" score="0.866">life</span> but a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came. 
<p>He had been some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, was engaged by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>river</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.331" formerWord="river" newWord="close" score="0.331">close</span>, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> intended a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span> to Georgiana that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>.

<p>Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>method</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.298" formerWord="method" newWord="field" score="0.298">field</span> of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>look</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.925" formerWord="look" newWord="nothing" score="0.925">nothing</span> somewhat nettled, she had all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="success" newWord="man" score="0.888">man</span> she expected.

<p>"Yes,"replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer,"but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="time" score="0.974">time</span>."

<p>Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span>, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.

<p>Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.

<p>She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span>.

<p>"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span>, as they drove from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>;"and really, upon serious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.914" formerWord="consideration" newWord="affection" score="0.914">affection</span>, I am much more inclined than I was to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.965" formerWord="judge" newWord="friend" score="0.965">friend</span> as your eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> does on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span>. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> should form such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.429" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.429">wife</span> against a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> who is by no means unprotected or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friendless</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.253" formerWord="friendless" newWord="gape" score="0.253">gape</span>, and who was actually staying in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>colonel</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.326" formerWord="colonel" newWord="midst" score="0.326">midst</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="regiment" newWord="family" score="0.93">family</span>, after such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affront</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.637" formerWord="affront" newWord="person" score="0.637">person</span> to Colonel Forster? His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="temptation" newWord="weakness" score="0.387">weakness</span> is not adequate to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>risk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.625" formerWord="risk" newWord="affair" score="0.625">affair</span>!"
<p>"Do you really think so?"cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span>. 
<p>"Upon my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span>,"said Mrs. Gardiner,"I begin to be of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span>.

I cannot think so very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ill</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="ill" newWord="son" score="0.95">son</span> of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"
<p>"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="interest" newWord="family" score="0.981">family</span>; but of every other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neglect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.465" formerWord="neglect" newWord="dance" score="0.465">dance</span> I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>?"
<p>"In the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>,"replied Mr. Gardiner,"there is no absolute <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proof</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="proof" newWord="nothing" score="0.855">nothing</span> that they are not gone to Scotland."
<p>"Oh! but their removing from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chaise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.298" formerWord="chaise" newWord="met" score="0.298">met</span> into a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hackney</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.269" formerWord="hackney" newWord="imitation" score="0.269">imitation</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.874" formerWord="coach" newWord="anything" score="0.874">anything</span> is such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>presumption</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.729" formerWord="presumption" newWord="subject" score="0.729">subject</span>! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>road</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="road" newWord="deal" score="0.796">deal</span>."
<p>"Well, then - - supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="purpose" newWord="part" score="0.828">part</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concealment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.366" formerWord="concealment" newWord="assertion" score="0.366">assertion</span>, for no more exceptional <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="purpose" newWord="part" score="0.828">part</span>. It is not likely that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="money" newWord="time" score="0.975">time</span> should be very abundant on either <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."
<p>"But why all this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>secrecy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.443" formerWord="secrecy" newWord="fault" score="0.443">fault</span>? Why any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fear</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.831" formerWord="fear" newWord="family" score="0.831">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>detection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.39" formerWord="detection" newWord="abode" score="0.39">abode</span>? Why must their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> be private? Oh, no, no - - this is not likely. His most particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>, you see by Jane's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.991">family</span>, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.

He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia - - what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attraction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.621" formerWord="attraction" newWord="thing" score="0.621">thing</span> has she beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>youth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.834" formerWord="youth" newWord="ball" score="0.834">ball</span>, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>health</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="health" newWord="pleasure" score="0.937">pleasure</span>, and good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.929" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.929">journey</span> that could make him, for her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sake</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.756" formerWord="sake" newWord="company" score="0.756">company</span>, forego every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="chance" newWord="time" score="0.924">time</span> of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>restraint</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.786" formerWord="restraint" newWord="account" score="0.786">account</span> the apprehensions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disgrace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="disgrace" newWord="time" score="0.857">time</span> in the corps might throw on a dishonourable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>elopement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.305" formerWord="elopement" newWord="barouche" score="0.305">barouche</span> with her, I am not able to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.965" formerWord="judge" newWord="friend" score="0.965">friend</span>; for I know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> of the effects that such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="step" newWord="round" score="0.724">round</span> might produce. But as to your other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>objection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.31" formerWord="objection" newWord="sentiment" score="0.31">sentiment</span>, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span>, from his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indolence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.498" formerWord="indolence" newWord="chief" score="0.498">chief</span> and the little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> could do, in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span>."
<p>"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="everything" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> but love of him as to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="consent" newWord="brother" score="0.966">brother</span> to live with him on any terms other than <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>?"
<p>"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes,"that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="sense" newWord="man" score="0.978">man</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>decency</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.232" formerWord="decency" newWord="pin" score="0.232">pin</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>virtue</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.814" formerWord="virtue" newWord="rest" score="0.814">rest</span> in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> should admit of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span>. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>justice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="justice" newWord="family" score="0.959">family</span>. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>twelvemonth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.723" formerWord="twelvemonth" newWord="answer" score="0.723">answer</span> - - she has been given up to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> but <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amusement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="amusement" newWord="way" score="0.86">way</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>vanity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.921" formerWord="vanity" newWord="woman" score="0.921">woman</span>. She has been allowed to dispose of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> in the most idle and frivolous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>, and to adopt any opinions that came in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>. Since the - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.337" formerWord="shire" newWord="distrust" score="0.337">distrust</span> were first quartered in Meryton, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> but love, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>flirtation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.228" formerWord="flirtation" newWord="merriment" score="0.228">merriment</span>, and officers have been in her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>head</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.883" formerWord="head" newWord="occasion" score="0.883">occasion</span>.

And we all know that Wickham has every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>charm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.891" formerWord="charm" newWord="sister" score="0.891">sister</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span> and address that can captivate a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>."
<p>"But you see that Jane,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>,"does not think so very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ill</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="ill" newWord="son" score="0.95">son</span> of Wickham as to believe him capable of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attempt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="attempt" newWord="affection" score="0.967">affection</span>."
<p>"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?

But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.

<p>"And do you really know all this?"cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span> as to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mode</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.617" formerWord="mode" newWord="haste" score="0.617">haste</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="character" score="0.866">character</span> was all alive. 
<p>"I do indeed,"replied Elizabeth, colouring."I told you, the other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, of his infamous <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> he spoke of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> who had behaved with such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>forbearance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.515" formerWord="forbearance" newWord="sort" score="0.515">sort</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>liberality</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.68" formerWord="liberality" newWord="daughter" score="0.68">daughter</span> towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>liberty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="liberty" newWord="part" score="0.724">part</span> - - which it is not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>worth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="worth" newWord="man" score="0.953">man</span> while to relate; but his lies about the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> Pemberley <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span>. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>unpretending</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.67" formerWord="unpretending" newWord="engagement" score="0.67">engagement</span> as we have found her."
<p>"But does Lydia know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"
<p>"Oh, yes! - - that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.516" formerWord="relation" newWord="park" score="0.516">park</span> Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span> myself. And when I returned <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>, the - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.337" formerWord="shire" newWord="distrust" score="0.337">distrust</span> was to leave Meryton in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.96">affection</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>. As that was the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>, neither Jane, to whom I related the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span>, nor I, thought it necessary to make our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>knowledge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.872" formerWord="knowledge" newWord="pleasure" score="0.872">pleasure</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>public</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.507" formerWord="public" newWord="housekeeper" score="0.507">housekeeper</span>; for of what <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.502" formerWord="use" newWord="suffering" score="0.502">suffering</span> could it apparently be to any one, that the good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span> which all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.675">duty</span> had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>necessity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="necessity" newWord="happiness" score="0.966">happiness</span> of opening her eyes to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> never occurred to me.

<p>"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span>, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"
<p>"Not the slightest.

Every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>girl</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="girl" newWord="man" score="0.988">man</span> in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span>; and, consequently, after a moderate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>period</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="period" newWord="sister" score="0.944">sister</span> of extravagant and wild <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>admiration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="admiration" newWord="nothing" score="0.893">nothing</span>, her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fancy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="fancy" newWord="family" score="0.949">family</span> for him gave <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, and others of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="regiment" newWord="family" score="0.93">family</span>, who treated her with more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distinction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.533" formerWord="distinction" newWord="weather" score="0.533">weather</span>, again became her favourites."

<p>Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span> in asking whether <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> had been heard of the fugitives.

<p>"And have you heard from him often?"

<p>Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span>, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="end" newWord="time" score="0.984">time</span> to by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>approach</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.761" formerWord="approach" newWord="country" score="0.761">country</span> of the whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>.

They must have seen them together for ever."
<p>"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>partiality</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="partiality" newWord="affection" score="0.938">affection</span>, especially on Lydia's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>, but <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> to give him any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alarm</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="alarm" newWord="sister" score="0.966">sister</span>.

His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> was attentive and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>utmost</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="utmost" newWord="brother" score="0.947">brother</span>.

<p>"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"
<p>"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Yes</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.883" formerWord="Yes" newWord="honour" score="0.883">Honour</span>; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> of their plans, and would not give his real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opinion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="opinion" newWord="nothing" score="0.977">nothing</span> about it. He did not repeat his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>persuasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="persuasion" newWord="friend" score="0.893">friend</span> of their not marrying - - and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."
<p>"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span>, I suppose, of their being really married?"
<p>"How was it possible that such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> should enter our brains?

Kitty then owned, with a very natural <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>triumph</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.284" formerWord="triumph" newWord="self-denying" score="0.284">self-denying</span> on knowing more than the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span> of us, that in Lydia's last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> she had prepared her for such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="step" newWord="round" score="0.724">round</span>.

<p>"But not before they went to Brighton?"
<p>"No, I believe not."
<p>"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he know his real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span>?"
<p>"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.942" formerWord="affair" newWord="friend" score="0.942">friend</span> has taken <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>debt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.243" formerWord="debt" newWord="route" score="0.243">route</span>; but I hope this may be false."
<p>"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"
<p>"Perhaps it would have been better,"replied her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>."But to expose the former faults of any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span> without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."
<p>"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>note</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="note" newWord="day" score="0.96">day</span> to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span>?"
<p>"He brought it with him for us to see."
<p>Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:

It was as follows:

<p>"Is it possible?"cried Elizabeth, when she had finished."Can it be possible that he will marry her?"
<p>"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>."My dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span>, I congratulate you."
<p>"And have you answered the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>?"cried Elizabeth. 
<p>"No; but it must be done soon."
<p>Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> before he wrote. 
<p>"Oh! my dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span>,"she cried,"come back and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>write</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.354" formerWord="write" newWord="discussion" score="0.354">discussion</span> immediately.

<p>"Let me write for you,"said Jane,"if you dislike the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trouble</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.957" formerWord="trouble" newWord="friend" score="0.957">friend</span> yourself."
<p>"I dislike it very much,"he replied;"but it must be done."
<p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>. 
<p>"And may I ask - -"said Elizabeth;"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."
<p>"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."
<p>"And they must marry! Yet he is such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>!"
<p>"Yes, yes, they must marry.

My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span>!"cried Jane,"what do you mean, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sir</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="sir" newWord="brother" score="0.966">brother</span>?"
<p>"I mean, that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="temptation" newWord="weakness" score="0.387">weakness</span> as one hundred a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span> during my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>life</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="life" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, and fifty after I am gone."
<p>"That is very true,"said Elizabeth;"though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> still to remain!

<p>"No,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span>;"Wickham's a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fool</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.368" formerWord="fool" newWord="composure" score="0.368">composure</span> if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.

<p>Mr. Bennet made no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>answer</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="answer" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, and each of them, deep in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thought</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="thought" newWord="life" score="0.922">life</span>, continued silent till they reached the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>. Their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> then went on to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>library</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.219" formerWord="library" newWord="associate" score="0.219">associate</span> to write, and the girls walked into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.325" formerWord="breakfast-room" newWord="title" score="0.325">title</span>. 
<p>"And they are really to be married!"cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves."How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful.

How could he spare <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.77" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.77">minute</span> ten thousand pounds?"
<p>"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,"said Elizabeth,"and how much is settled on his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> on our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.

<p>It now occurred to the girls that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> was in all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>likelihood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.289" formerWord="likelihood" newWord="inn" score="0.289">inn</span> perfectly ignorant of what had happened.

<p>Their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="wedding" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> was sent to meet them at - - - -, and they were to return in it by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner-time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.671" formerWord="dinner-time" newWord="visit" score="0.671">visit</span>. Their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thought</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.922" formerWord="thought" newWord="life" score="0.922">life</span> of what her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> must endure. 
<p>They came. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> were assembled in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="influence" score="0.725">influence</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span> to receive them. Smiles decked the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.255" formerWord="face" newWord="reproach" score="0.255">reproach</span> of Mrs. Bennet as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> drove up to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.978">time</span>; her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="husband" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> looked impenetrably <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>grave</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.464" formerWord="grave" newWord="education" score="0.464">education</span>; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy. 
<p>Lydia's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>voice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="voice" newWord="brother" score="0.984">brother</span> was heard in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>vestibule</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.437" formerWord="vestibule" newWord="self-importance" score="0.437">self-importance</span>; the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.978">time</span> was thrown open, and she ran into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rapture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.555" formerWord="rapture" newWord="consequence" score="0.555">consequence</span>; gave her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hand</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="hand" newWord="family" score="0.975">family</span>, with an affectionate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>, to Wickham, who followed his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span>; and wished them both <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>joy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.954" formerWord="joy" newWord="brother" score="0.954">brother</span> with an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alacrity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.813" formerWord="alacrity" newWord="acquaintance" score="0.813">acquaintance</span> which shewed no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span> of their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>. 
<p>Their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reception</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.346" formerWord="reception" newWord="plain" score="0.346">plain</span> from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>countenance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="countenance" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> rather gained in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>austerity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.227" formerWord="austerity" newWord="extension" score="0.227">extension</span>; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assurance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="assurance" newWord="heart" score="0.882">heart</span> of the young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>couple</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.244" formerWord="couple" newWord="sat" score="0.244">sat</span>, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>length</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="length" newWord="everything" score="0.967">everything</span> they all sat down, looked eagerly <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="round" newWord="minute" score="0.875">minute</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>, took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>notice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.937" formerWord="notice" newWord="her" score="0.937">her</span> of some little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>alteration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.834" formerWord="alteration" newWord="family" score="0.834">family</span> in it, and observed, with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>laugh</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.578" formerWord="laugh" newWord="horror" score="0.578">horror</span>, that it was a great while since she had been there. 
<p>Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>address</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.729" formerWord="address" newWord="justice" score="0.729">justice</span>, while he claimed their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relationship</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="relationship" newWord="minute" score="0.777">minute</span>, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assurance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="assurance" newWord="heart" score="0.882">heart</span>; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impudence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.388" formerWord="impudence" newWord="ear" score="0.388">ear</span> of an impudent <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.345" formerWord="confusion" newWord="curiosity" score="0.345">curiosity</span> suffered no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>variation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.294" formerWord="variation" newWord="existence" score="0.294">existence</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>colour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.87" formerWord="colour" newWord="party" score="0.87">party</span>. 
<p>There was no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="want" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>discourse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.264" formerWord="discourse" newWord="century" score="0.264">century</span>. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>bride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.72" formerWord="bride" newWord="mother" score="0.72">mother</span> and her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>acquaintance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="acquaintance" newWord="time" score="0.974">time</span> in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>neighbourhood</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.675" formerWord="neighbourhood" newWord="duty" score="0.675">duty</span>, with a good humoured <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="ease" newWord="friend" score="0.971">friend</span> which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span>. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">Course</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>past</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.301" formerWord="past" newWord="confidence" score="0.301">confidence</span> was recollected with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pain</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="pain" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span>; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span>. 
<p>"Only think of its being three months,"she cried,"since I went away; it seems but a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.96">affection</span> I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>idea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="idea" newWord="time" score="0.988">time</span> of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fun</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.608" formerWord="fun" newWord="behaviour" score="0.608">behaviour</span> if I was."
<p>Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,"Oh! <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="mamma" newWord="friend" score="0.89">friend</span>, do the people hereabouts know I am married <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>to-day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.37" formerWord="to-day" newWord="music" score="0.37">music</span>? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curricle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.893" formerWord="curricle" newWord="mother" score="0.893">mother</span>, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side-glass</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.225" formerWord="side-glass" newWord="taught" score="0.225">taught</span> next to him, and took off my glove, and let my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hand</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="hand" newWord="family" score="0.975">family</span> just <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span> upon the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>window</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.34" formerWord="window" newWord="agreeableness" score="0.34">agreeableness</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>frame</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.406" formerWord="frame" newWord="dirt" score="0.406">dirt</span>, so that he might see the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.599" formerWord="ring" newWord="justice" score="0.599">justice</span>, and then I bowed and smiled like <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>."
<p>Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.29" formerWord="hall" newWord="pelisse" score="0.29">pelisse</span> to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dining</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.788" formerWord="dining" newWord="minute" score="0.788">minute</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>parlour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.338" formerWord="parlour" newWord="distance" score="0.338">distance</span>. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>parade</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="parade" newWord="certainty" score="0.387">certainty</span>, walk up to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>'s right <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hand</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="hand" newWord="family" score="0.975">family</span>, and hear her say to her eldest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>,"Ah! Jane, I take your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> now, and you must go lower, because I am a married <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>."
<p>It was not to be supposed that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> would give Lydia that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>embarrassment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.369" formerWord="embarrassment" newWord="shortness" score="0.369">shortness</span> from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="ease" newWord="friend" score="0.971">friend</span> and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called"Mrs. Wickham"by each of them; and in the mean <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, she went after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="dinner" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span> to show her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.599" formerWord="ring" newWord="justice" score="0.599">justice</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>boast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.464" formerWord="boast" newWord="horror" score="0.464">horror</span> of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids. 
<p>"Well, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="mamma" newWord="friend" score="0.89">friend</span>,"said she, when they were all returned to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="influence" score="0.725">influence</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>,"and what do you think of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>husband</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="husband" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span>? Is not he a charming <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>? I am sure my sisters must all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>envy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.309" formerWord="envy" newWord="park" score="0.309">park</span> me. I only hope they may have half my good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>luck</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.535" formerWord="luck" newWord="order" score="0.535">order</span>. They must all go to Brighton. That is the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> to get husbands. What a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="pity" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> it is, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="mamma" newWord="friend" score="0.89">friend</span>, we did not all go."
<p>"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> off. Must it be so?"
<p>"Oh, <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lord</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.369" formerWord="lord" newWord="shrubbery" score="0.369">shrubbery</span>! yes; - - there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> in that. I shall like it of all things. You and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>papa</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.787" formerWord="papa" newWord="affection" score="0.787">affection</span>, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>winter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.483" formerWord="winter" newWord="mind" score="0.483">mind</span>, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>care</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.903" formerWord="care" newWord="affection" score="0.903">affection</span> to get good partners for them all."
<p>"I should like it beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>!"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>. 
<p>"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>winter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.483" formerWord="winter" newWord="mind" score="0.483">mind</span> is over."
<p>"I thank you for my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>share</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.466" formerWord="share" newWord="horror" score="0.466">horror</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>favour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="favour" newWord="time" score="0.976">time</span>,"said Elizabeth;"but I do not particularly like your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> of getting husbands."
<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>commission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="commission" newWord="talk" score="0.678">talk</span> before he left London, and he was to join his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="regiment" newWord="family" score="0.93">family</span> at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="end" newWord="time" score="0.984">time</span> of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.96">affection</span>. 
<p>No <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>stay</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.787" formerWord="stay" newWord="point" score="0.787">point</span> would be so short; and she made the most of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> by visiting about with her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span>, and having very frequent parties at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>circle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.774" formerWord="circle" newWord="home" score="0.774">home</span> was even more desirable to such as did <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>think</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.33" formerWord="think" newWord="matrimony" score="0.33">matrimony</span>, than such as did not. 
<p>Wickham's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.85">minute</span> to be satisfied, from the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> of things, that their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>elopement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.305" formerWord="elopement" newWord="barouche" score="0.305">barouche</span> had been brought on by the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>strength</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="strength" newWord="happiness" score="0.924">happiness</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span>, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>flight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.383" formerWord="flight" newWord="concerto" score="0.383">concerto</span> was rendered necessary by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="distress" newWord="friend" score="0.96">friend</span> of circumstances; and if that were the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>, he was not the young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> to resist an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of having a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>companion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="companion" newWord="affection" score="0.924">affection</span>. 
<p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>occasion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="occasion" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span>; no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> was to be put in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>competition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.281" formerWord="competition" newWord="heaven" score="0.281">heaven</span> with him. He did every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> best in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span>; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>body</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.537" formerWord="body" newWord="dining" score="0.537">dining</span> else in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span>. 
<p>One <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>, soon after their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span>, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: 
<p>"Lizzy, I never gave you an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.991">family</span> of my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="wedding" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span>, I believe. You were not by, when I told <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="mamma" newWord="friend" score="0.89">friend</span> and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"
<p>"No really,"replied Elizabeth;"I think there cannot be too little said on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span>."
<p>"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement ' s, because Wickham's lodgings were in that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>parish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.617" formerWord="parish" newWord="consent" score="0.617">consent</span>. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>church</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.487" formerWord="church" newWord="visit" score="0.487">visit</span>. Well, Monday <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> came, and I was in such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fuss</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.449" formerWord="fuss" newWord="minute" score="0.449">minute</span>! I was so afraid, you know, that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> I was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dressing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.401" formerWord="dressing" newWord="wait" score="0.401">wait</span>, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sermon</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.239" formerWord="sermon" newWord="groom" score="0.239">groom</span>. However, I did not hear above one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.516" formerWord="coat" newWord="chair" score="0.516">chair</span>."
<p>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> were horrid unpleasant all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>foot</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.552" formerWord="foot" newWord="park" score="0.552">park</span> out of doors, though I was there a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortnight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="fortnight" newWord="affection" score="0.96">affection</span>. Not one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scheme</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.976" formerWord="scheme" newWord="brother" score="0.976">brother</span>, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> came to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.978">time</span>, my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> was called away upon <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> to that horrid <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>end</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="end" newWord="time" score="0.984">time</span> of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> was to give me away; and if we were beyond the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.679">mile</span>, we could not be married all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes ' <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, and then we all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>set</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.919" formerWord="set" newWord="idea" score="0.919">idea</span> out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="wedding" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span> need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."
<p>"Mr. Darcy!"repeated Elizabeth, in utter <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amazement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.754" formerWord="amazement" newWord="anger" score="0.754">anger</span>. 
<p>"Oh, yes! - - he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"
<p>"If it was to be secret,"said Jane,"say not another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>word</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="word" newWord="sister" score="0.969">sister</span> on the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span>. You may depend upon my seeking no further."
<p>"Oh! certainly,"said Elizabeth, though <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>burning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.286" formerWord="burning" newWord="pleasanter" score="0.286">pleasanter</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span>;"we will ask you no questions."
<p>"Thank you,"said Lydia,"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."
<p>On such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>encouragement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="encouragement" newWord="brother" score="0.955">brother</span> to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>power</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.887" formerWord="power" newWord="nothing" score="0.887">nothing</span>, by running away. 
<p>But to live in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ignorance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.642" formerWord="ignorance" newWord="horror" score="0.642">horror</span> on such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>point</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="point" newWord="brother" score="0.974">brother</span> was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="information" newWord="situation" score="0.86">situation</span>. Mr. Darcy had been at her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="wedding" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span>. It was exactly a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>scene</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.934" formerWord="scene" newWord="affection" score="0.934">affection</span>, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="temptation" newWord="weakness" score="0.387">weakness</span> to go. Conjectures as to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meaning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.796" formerWord="meaning" newWord="day" score="0.796">day</span> of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brain</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.894" formerWord="brain" newWord="brother" score="0.894">brother</span>; but she was satisfied with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="none" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span>. Those that best pleased her, as placing his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conduct</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.943" formerWord="conduct" newWord="kind" score="0.943">kind</span> in the noblest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>light</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.302" formerWord="light" newWord="composure" score="0.302">composure</span>, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>suspense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.572" formerWord="suspense" newWord="selfishness" score="0.572">selfishness</span>; and hastily seizing a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sheet</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.252" formerWord="sheet" newWord="counter" score="0.252">counter</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>paper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.645" formerWord="paper" newWord="hearing" score="0.645">hearing</span>, wrote a short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>request</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="request" newWord="none" score="0.808">none</span> an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>explanation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.92" formerWord="explanation" newWord="mother" score="0.92">mother</span> of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>secrecy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.443" formerWord="secrecy" newWord="fault" score="0.443">fault</span> which had been intended. 
<p>"You may readily comprehend,"she added,"what my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span> must be to know how a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span> unconnected with any of us, and ( comparatively <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speaking</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="speaking" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> ) a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>stranger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.359" formerWord="stranger" newWord="humour" score="0.359">humour</span> to our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, should have been amongst you at such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>.

<p>"Not that I shall, though,"she added to herself, as she finished the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>;"and my dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, if you do not tell me in an honourable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."

<p>"MY DEAR NIECE, 
<p>"I have just received your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, and shall devote this whole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> to answering it, as I foresee that a little <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>writing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.628" formerWord="writing" newWord="cause" score="0.628">cause</span> will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>application</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.393" formerWord="application" newWord="agreement" score="0.393">agreement</span>; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impertinence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.242" formerWord="impertinence" newWord="deference" score="0.242">deference</span>. Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> is as much surprised as I am - - and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>belief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.219" formerWord="belief" newWord="foresight" score="0.219">foresight</span> of your being a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span> concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. 
<p>"On the very <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> of my coming <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> from Longbourn, your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> had a most unexpected <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.409" formerWord="visitor" newWord="attendance" score="0.409">attendance</span>. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span> was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> after ourselves, and came to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resolution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.895" formerWord="resolution" newWord="life" score="0.895">life</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hunting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.421" formerWord="hunting" newWord="met" score="0.421">met</span> for them. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>motive</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.923" formerWord="motive" newWord="brother" score="0.923">brother</span> professed was his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conviction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="conviction" newWord="friend" score="0.962">friend</span> of its being owing to himself that Wickham's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>worthlessness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.226" formerWord="worthlessness" newWord="intent" score="0.226">intent</span> had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>woman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="woman" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pride</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.973" formerWord="pride" newWord="sister" score="0.973">sister</span>, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>world</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="world" newWord="man" score="0.982">man</span>. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>duty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="duty" newWord="time" score="0.98">time</span> to step forward, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>endeavour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.35" formerWord="endeavour" newWord="person" score="0.35">person</span> to remedy an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evil</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="evil" newWord="letter" score="0.962">letter</span> which had been brought on by himself. If he had another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>motive</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.923" formerWord="motive" newWord="brother" score="0.923">brother</span>, I am sure it would never <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disgrace</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="disgrace" newWord="time" score="0.857">time</span> him. He had been some days in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, before he was able to discover them; but he had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> to direct his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>search</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.734" formerWord="search" newWord="part" score="0.734">part</span>, which was more than we had; and the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consciousness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.795" formerWord="consciousness" newWord="horror" score="0.795">horror</span> of this was another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> for his resolving to follow us. 
<p>"There is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span>, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> ago <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>governess</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.253" formerWord="governess" newWord="animal" score="0.253">animal</span> to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>charge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.237" formerWord="charge" newWord="mercy" score="0.237">mercy</span> on some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cause</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.921" formerWord="cause" newWord="affection" score="0.921">affection</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disapprobation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.26" formerWord="disapprobation" newWord="volume" score="0.26">volume</span>, though he did not say what. She then took a large <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>intelligence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.866" formerWord="intelligence" newWord="character" score="0.866">character</span> of him as soon as he got to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>trust</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.915" formerWord="trust" newWord="man" score="0.915">man</span>, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>arrival</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="arrival" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> in London, and had she been able to receive them into her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>, they would have taken up their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>abode</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="abode" newWord="minute" score="0.817">minute</span> with her. At <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>length</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="length" newWord="everything" score="0.967">everything</span>, however, our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>kind</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="kind" newWord="nothing" score="0.99">nothing</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> procured the wished-for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>direction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.821" formerWord="direction" newWord="friend" score="0.821">friend</span>. They were in - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>street</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="street" newWord="time" score="0.951">time</span>. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span>, and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>return</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="return" newWord="brother" score="0.979">brother</span> to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assistance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.413" formerWord="assistance" newWord="barouche" score="0.413">barouche</span>, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>none</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="none" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> of her friends; she wanted no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>help</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.29" formerWord="help" newWord="duration" score="0.29">duration</span> of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>, which, in his very first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.429" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.429">wife</span>. He confessed himself obliged to leave the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="regiment" newWord="family" score="0.93">family</span>, on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.991">family</span> of some debts of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>honour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="honour" newWord="happiness" score="0.986">happiness</span>, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>flight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.383" formerWord="flight" newWord="concerto" score="0.383">concerto</span> on her own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>folly</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.645" formerWord="folly" newWord="walk" score="0.645">walk</span> alone. He meant to resign his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>commission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="commission" newWord="talk" score="0.678">talk</span> immediately; and as to his future <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span>, he could <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conjecture</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.283" formerWord="conjecture" newWord="wit" score="0.283">wit</span> very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> to live on. 
<p>"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> for him, and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span> must have been benefited by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>. But he found, in reply to this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.962">time</span>, that Wickham still cherished the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hope</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="hope" newWord="day" score="0.972">day</span> of more effectually making his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> in some other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>country</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="country" newWord="family" score="0.987">family</span>. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proof</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.855" formerWord="proof" newWord="nothing" score="0.855">nothing</span> against the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>temptation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.387" formerWord="temptation" newWord="weakness" score="0.387">weakness</span> of immediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>relief</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.698" formerWord="relief" newWord="expectation" score="0.698">expectation</span>. 
<p>"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> wanted more than he could get; but at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>length</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="length" newWord="everything" score="0.967">everything</span> was reduced to be reasonable. 
<p>"Every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>step</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.724" formerWord="step" newWord="round" score="0.724">round</span> was to make your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>street</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="street" newWord="time" score="0.951">time</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> before I came <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>inquiry</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.683" formerWord="inquiry" newWord="house" score="0.683">house</span>, that your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> was still with him, but would quit <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>. He did not <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judge</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.965" formerWord="judge" newWord="friend" score="0.965">friend</span> your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> to be a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>person</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="person" newWord="time" score="0.947">time</span> whom he could so properly consult as your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span>, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>departure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.808" formerWord="departure" newWord="news" score="0.808">news</span> of the former. He did not leave his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="name" newWord="family" score="0.971">family</span>, and till the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span> it was only known that a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.912">marriage</span> had called on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span>. 
<p>"On Saturday he came again. Your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span> was gone, your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>, and, as I said before, they had a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>deal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="deal" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>talk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="talk" newWord="happiness" score="0.933">happiness</span> together. 
<p>"They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too.

But our <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visitor</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.409" formerWord="visitor" newWord="attendance" score="0.409">attendance</span> was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>obstinacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.248" formerWord="obstinacy" newWord="shoulder" score="0.248">shoulder</span> is the real <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>defect</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.605" formerWord="defect" newWord="minute" score="0.605">minute</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span>, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">Course</span> was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> about it ), your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> would most readily have settled the whole. 
<p>"They battled it together for a long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, which was more than either the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gentleman</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.912" formerWord="gentleman" newWord="marriage" score="0.912">marriage</span> or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span> concerned in it deserved. But at last your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>uncle</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.508" formerWord="uncle" newWord="present" score="0.508">present</span> was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>use</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.502" formerWord="use" newWord="suffering" score="0.502">suffering</span> to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>niece</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="niece" newWord="love" score="0.853">love</span>, was forced to put up with only having the probable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="credit" newWord="love" score="0.817">love</span> of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> gave him great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, because it required an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>explanation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.92" formerWord="explanation" newWord="mother" score="0.92">mother</span> that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>praise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.948" formerWord="praise" newWord="time" score="0.948">time</span> where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most. 
<p>"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>addition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.876" formerWord="addition" newWord="mother" score="0.876">mother</span> to her own settled upon her, and his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>commission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.678" formerWord="commission" newWord="talk" score="0.678">talk</span> purchased. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reserve</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.385" formerWord="reserve" newWord="weather" score="0.385">weather</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>want</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="want" newWord="time" score="0.938">time</span> of proper <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consideration</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.914" formerWord="consideration" newWord="affection" score="0.914">affection</span>, that Wickham's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>character</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.977" formerWord="character" newWord="family" score="0.977">family</span> had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.

<p>"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wedding</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.924" formerWord="wedding" newWord="brother" score="0.924">brother</span> took <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>, and all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>money</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="money" newWord="time" score="0.975">time</span> matters were then to receive the last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>finish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.263" formerWord="finish" newWord="huswife" score="0.263">huswife</span>.

<p>"You certainly do,"she replied with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>;"but it does not follow that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interruption</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.303" formerWord="interruption" newWord="grove" score="0.303">grove</span> must be unwelcome."
<p>"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better."
<p>"True. Are the others coming out?"
<p>"I do not know.

<p>She replied in the affirmative. 
<p>"I almost envy you the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to Newcastle.

<p>"Yes, she did."
<p>"And what did she say?"
<p>"That you were gone into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>army</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.289" formerWord="army" newWord="key" score="0.289">key</span>, and she was afraid had - - not turned out well.

<p>"Certainly,"he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:

We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there."
<p>"Perhaps preparing for his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>marriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="marriage" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> with Miss de Bourgh,"said Elizabeth."It must be <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> particular, to take him there at this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>."
<p>"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."
<p>"<span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Yes</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.883" formerWord="Yes" newWord="honour" score="0.883">Honour</span>; he introduced us to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>."
<p>"And do you like her?"
<p>"Very much."
<p>"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span> or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."
<p>"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>age</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="age" newWord="affection" score="0.975">affection</span>."

<p>"I do not recollect that we did."

<p>"How should you have liked making sermons?"
<p>"Exceedingly well.

<p>"I did <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hear</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.399" formerWord="hear" newWord="injury" score="0.399">injury</span>, too, that there was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>present</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="present" newWord="brother" score="0.959">brother</span>; that you actually declared your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resolution</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.895" formerWord="resolution" newWord="life" score="0.895">life</span> of never taking orders, and that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> had been compromised accordingly."

<p>Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> Elizabeth, by introducing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span> of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.

<p>"Write to me very often, my dear."
<p>"As often as I can.

<p>Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span> ' s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

<p>"I often think,"said she,"that there is <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> so bad as parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."

And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"
<p>"You may depend on it,"replied the other,"for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>night</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.946" formerWord="night" newWord="life" score="0.946">life</span>; I saw her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>passing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.413" formerWord="passing" newWord="shortness" score="0.413">shortness</span> by, and went out myself on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="purpose" newWord="part" score="0.828">part</span> to know the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>truth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.952" formerWord="truth" newWord="sister" score="0.952">sister</span> of it; and she told me that it was certain true.

<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>name</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="name" newWord="family" score="0.971">family</span> to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said: 
<p>"I saw you look at me <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>to-day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.37" formerWord="to-day" newWord="music" score="0.37">music</span>, Lizzy, when my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>aunt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="aunt" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> told us of the present <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>report</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.554" formerWord="report" newWord="intimacy" score="0.554">intimacy</span>; and I know I appeared distressed.

<p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.375" formerWord="view" newWord="dirt" score="0.375">dirt</span> than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>probability</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.849" formerWord="probability" newWord="family" score="0.849">family</span> of his coming there with his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>permission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.267" formerWord="permission" newWord="newspaper" score="0.267">newspaper</span>, or being bold enough to come without it. 
<p>"Yet it is hard,"she sometimes thought,"that this poor <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> cannot come to a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span> which he has legally hired, without raising all this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>speculation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.41" formerWord="speculation" newWord="exertion" score="0.41">exertion</span>!

They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.

<p>"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,"said Mrs. Bennet,"you will wait on him of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span>."
<p>"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>year</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="year" newWord="family" score="0.98">family</span>, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.

<p>His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wife</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.933" formerWord="wife" newWord="man" score="0.933">man</span> represented to him how absolutely necessary such an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attention</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.951" formerWord="attention" newWord="brother" score="0.951">brother</span> would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.

<p>"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span> at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.548" formerWord="table" newWord="morning" score="0.548">morning</span> for him."

<p>Jane looked at Elizabeth with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concern</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="concern" newWord="sister" score="0.862">sister</span>. She knew but little of their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meeting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.936" formerWord="meeting" newWord="family" score="0.936">family</span> in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>awkwardness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.261" formerWord="awkwardness" newWord="disturbance" score="0.261">disturbance</span> which must attend her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, in seeing him almost for the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> after receiving his explanatory <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span>.

<p>She sat intently at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>work</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="work" newWord="nothing" score="0.955">nothing</span>, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span> carried them to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.255" formerWord="face" newWord="reproach" score="0.255">reproach</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> as the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>servant</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.608" formerWord="servant" newWord="word" score="0.608">word</span> was approaching the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>door</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="door" newWord="time" score="0.978">time</span>. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ease</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.971" formerWord="ease" newWord="friend" score="0.971">friend</span>, and with a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>propriety</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.837" formerWord="propriety" newWord="none" score="0.837">none</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> equally free from any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>symptom</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.274" formerWord="symptom" newWord="shop" score="0.274">shop</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>resentment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.386" formerWord="resentment" newWord="papa" score="0.386">papa</span> or any unnecessary <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>complaisance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.23" formerWord="complaisance" newWord="cart" score="0.23">cart</span>. 
<p>Elizabeth said as little to either as <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="civility" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> would allow, and sat down again to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>work</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.955" formerWord="work" newWord="nothing" score="0.955">nothing</span>, with an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>eagerness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="eagerness" newWord="nothing" score="0.862">nothing</span> which it did not often command.

He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.

<p>Bingley, she had likewise seen for an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>instant</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.683" formerWord="instant" newWord="observation" score="0.683">observation</span>, and in that short <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>period</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="period" newWord="sister" score="0.944">sister</span> saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.

<p>Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> owed to the latter the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>preservation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.245" formerWord="preservation" newWord="dose" score="0.245">dose</span> of her favourite <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> from irremediable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>infamy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.422" formerWord="infamy" newWord="wonder" score="0.422">wonder</span>, was hurt and distressed to a most painful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>degree</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="degree" newWord="sister" score="0.982">sister</span> by a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distinction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.533" formerWord="distinction" newWord="weather" score="0.533">weather</span> so ill applied. 
<p>Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.962">time</span> which she could not answer without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.345" formerWord="confusion" newWord="curiosity" score="0.345">curiosity</span>, said scarcely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.956" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.956">sister</span>; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sound</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.726" formerWord="sound" newWord="object" score="0.726">object</span> of his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>voice</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="voice" newWord="brother" score="0.984">brother</span>; and when occasionally, unable to resist the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impulse</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.418" formerWord="impulse" newWord="necessity" score="0.418">necessity</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span>, she raised her eyes to his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>face</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.255" formerWord="face" newWord="reproach" score="0.255">reproach</span>, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>object</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="object" newWord="day" score="0.974">day</span> but the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>ground</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.278" formerWord="ground" newWord="slope" score="0.278">slope</span>.

She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so. 
<p>"Could I expect it to be otherwise!"said she."Yet why did he come?"
<p>She was in no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.929" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.929">journey</span> for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> with <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anyone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.361" formerWord="anyone" newWord="minute" score="0.361">minute</span> but himself; and to him she had hardly <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>courage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.55" formerWord="courage" newWord="thought" score="0.55">thought</span> to speak. 
<p>She inquired after his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>, but could do no more. 
<p>"It is a long <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,"said Mrs. Bennet. 
<p>He readily agreed to it. 
<p>"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.

Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ' Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet, ' without there being a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>syllable</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.378" formerWord="syllable" newWord="chair" score="0.378">chair</span> said of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>father</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="father" newWord="aunt" score="0.95">aunt</span>, or the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> where she lived, or <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span>. It was my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>brother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="brother" newWord="family" score="0.996">family</span> Gardiner's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drawing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.525" formerWord="drawing" newWord="water" score="0.525">water</span> up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>business</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="business" newWord="time" score="0.981">time</span> of it. Did you see it?"
<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell. 
<p>"It is a delightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>, to be sure, to have a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>daughter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.927" formerWord="daughter" newWord="nothing" score="0.927">nothing</span> well married,"continued her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>,"but at the same <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span> quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>regiment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.93" formerWord="regiment" newWord="family" score="0.93">family</span> is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the - - - - <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.337" formerWord="shire" newWord="distrust" score="0.337">distrust</span>, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."
<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>misery</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="misery" newWord="time" score="0.917">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>shame</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.949" formerWord="shame" newWord="happiness" score="0.949">happiness</span>, that she could hardly keep her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>seat</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.704" formerWord="seat" newWord="sort" score="0.704">sort</span>.

<p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>civility</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="civility" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span>, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>.

<p>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>interruption</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.303" formerWord="interruption" newWord="grove" score="0.303">grove</span> on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> astonished and vexed her.

<p>She could settle it in no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> that gave her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>.

<p>"Now,"said she,"that this first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>meeting</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.936" formerWord="meeting" newWord="family" score="0.936">family</span> is over, I feel perfectly easy.

<p>"I think you are in very great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>danger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.945" formerWord="danger" newWord="family" score="0.945">family</span> of making him as much in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>love</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="love" newWord="man" score="0.984">man</span> with you as ever."

<p>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to all the happy schemes, which the good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.929" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.929">journey</span> and common <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>politeness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.853" formerWord="politeness" newWord="country" score="0.853">country</span> of Bingley, in half an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.679">mile</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span>, had revived.

When they repaired to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dining-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.331" formerWord="dining-room" newWord="error" score="0.331">error</span>, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>place</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="place" newWord="family" score="0.99">family</span>, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>.

On entering the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="round" newWord="minute" score="0.875">minute</span>, and happened to smile: it was decided.

It gave her all the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>animation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.416" formerWord="animation" newWord="minute" score="0.416">minute</span> that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.929" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.929">journey</span>.

She knew how little such a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span> would give <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> to either, or make either appear to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.583" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.583">minute</span>.

<p>She was in hopes that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> would afford some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of bringing them together; that the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whole</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.974" formerWord="whole" newWord="family" score="0.974">family</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span> would not pass away without enabling them to enter into <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>something</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.851" formerWord="something" newWord="mind" score="0.851">mind</span> more of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> than the mere ceremonious <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>salutation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.313" formerWord="salutation" newWord="service" score="0.313">service</span> attending his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>entrance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.915" formerWord="entrance" newWord="week" score="0.915">week</span>.

<p>"If he does not come to me, then,"said she,"I shall give him up for ever."
<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>round</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.875" formerWord="round" newWord="minute" score="0.875">minute</span> the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>table</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.548" formerWord="table" newWord="morning" score="0.548">morning</span>, where Miss Bennet was making <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="tea" newWord="time" score="0.908">time</span>, and Elizabeth pouring out the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.345" formerWord="coffee" newWord="hurry" score="0.345">hurry</span>, in so close a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confederacy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.226" formerWord="confederacy" newWord="sedateness" score="0.226">sedateness</span> that there was not a single <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>vacancy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.258" formerWord="vacancy" newWord="profligacy" score="0.258">profligacy</span> near her which would admit of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>chair</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.793" formerWord="chair" newWord="haste" score="0.793">haste</span>. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whisper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.411" formerWord="whisper" newWord="furniture" score="0.411">furniture</span>: 
<p>"The men shan't come and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> us, I am determined.

<p>Darcy had walked away to another <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>part</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="part" newWord="family" score="0.989">family</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>. She followed him with her eyes, envied <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>everyone</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.392" formerWord="everyone" newWord="value" score="0.392">value</span> to whom he spoke, had scarcely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>patience</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="patience" newWord="aunt" score="0.938">aunt</span> enough to help <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anybody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="anybody" newWord="way" score="0.969">way</span> to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.345" formerWord="coffee" newWord="hurry" score="0.345">hurry</span>; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! 
<p>"A <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> who has once been refused!

<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>coffee</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.345" formerWord="coffee" newWord="hurry" score="0.345">hurry</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>cup</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.23" formerWord="cup" newWord="hymen" score="0.23">hymen</span> himself; and she seized the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of saying: 
<p>"Is your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> at Pemberley still?"
<p>"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
<p>"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"
<p>"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."
<p>She could think of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>success</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.888" formerWord="success" newWord="man" score="0.888">man</span>. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>silence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.956" formerWord="silence" newWord="sister" score="0.956">sister</span>; and, at last, on the young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>lady</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.791" formerWord="lady" newWord="husband" score="0.791">husband</span>'s <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whispering</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.568" formerWord="whispering" newWord="week" score="0.568">week</span> to Elizabeth again, he walked away. 
<p>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>'s rapacity for <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>whist</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.474" formerWord="whist" newWord="judgment" score="0.474">judgment</span> players, and in a few moments after seated with the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>rest</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.984" formerWord="rest" newWord="nothing" score="0.984">nothing</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span>. She now lost every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>expectation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="expectation" newWord="time" score="0.975">time</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>pleasure</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="pleasure" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span>. They were confined for the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> at different tables, and she had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>side</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="side" newWord="nothing" score="0.959">nothing</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span>, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself. 
<p>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>supper</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.386" formerWord="supper" newWord="wonder" score="0.386">wonder</span>; but their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>carriage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.986" formerWord="carriage" newWord="brother" score="0.986">brother</span> was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>opportunity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.967" formerWord="opportunity" newWord="day" score="0.967">day</span> of detaining them. 
<p>"Well girls,"said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,"What say you to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>? I think every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dinner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="dinner" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span> was as well dressed as any I ever saw.

The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>soup</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.457" formerWord="soup" newWord="cause" score="0.457">cause</span> was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases ' last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>week</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="week" newWord="brother" score="0.988">brother</span>; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beauty</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="beauty" newWord="family" score="0.975">family</span>. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? ' Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last. ' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>creature</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.777" formerWord="creature" newWord="woman" score="0.777">woman</span> as ever lived - - and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."
<p>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>behaviour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.947" formerWord="behaviour" newWord="family" score="0.947">family</span> to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>advantage</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.583" formerWord="advantage" newWord="minute" score="0.583">minute</span> to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span>, when in a happy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>humour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.929" formerWord="humour" newWord="journey" score="0.929">journey</span>, were so far beyond <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span>, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, to make his proposals. 
<p>"It has been a very agreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>,"said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth."The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>party</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.982" formerWord="party" newWord="family" score="0.982">family</span> seemed so well selected, so suitable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> with the other. I hope we may often meet again."
<p>Elizabeth smiled. 
<p>"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> as an agreeable and sensible young <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>, without having a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wish</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="wish" newWord="brother" score="0.99">brother</span> beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>design</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.429" formerWord="design" newWord="wife" score="0.429">wife</span> of engaging my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. It is only that he is blessed with greater <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sweetness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.803" formerWord="sweetness" newWord="minute" score="0.803">minute</span> of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>address</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.729" formerWord="address" newWord="justice" score="0.729">justice</span>, and a stronger <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>desire</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.856" formerWord="desire" newWord="kindness" score="0.856">kindness</span> of generally pleasing, than any other <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>."
<p>"You are very cruel,"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>,"you will not let me <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>smile</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.857" formerWord="smile" newWord="town" score="0.857">town</span>, and are provoking me to it every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>moment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.932" formerWord="moment" newWord="honour" score="0.932">honour</span>."
<p>"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"
<p>"And how impossible in others!"
<p>"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"
<p>"That is a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.962">time</span> which I hardly know how to answer.

<p>A few days after this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>visit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.95" formerWord="visit" newWord="day" score="0.95">day</span>, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> had left him that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span> for London, but was to return <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> in ten days <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>. He sat with them above an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.679">mile</span>, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>concern</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.862" formerWord="concern" newWord="sister" score="0.862">sister</span>, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere. 
<p>"Next <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> you call,"said she,"I hope we shall be more lucky."

<p>"We will be down as soon as we can,"said Jane;"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>half</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.77" formerWord="half" newWord="minute" score="0.77">minute</span> an <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hour</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.679" formerWord="hour" newWord="mile" score="0.679">mile</span> ago."

<p>But when her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.

Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, without making any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>impression</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.871" formerWord="impression" newWord="part" score="0.871">part</span> on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said,"What is the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mamma</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.89" formerWord="mamma" newWord="friend" score="0.89">friend</span>?

Jane instantly gave a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>look</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.925" formerWord="look" newWord="nothing" score="0.925">nothing</span> at Elizabeth which spoke her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>distress</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.96" formerWord="distress" newWord="friend" score="0.96">friend</span> at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in to it.

<p>"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
<p>Elizabeth was forced to go. 
<p>"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"said her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>, as soon as she was in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>hall</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.29" formerWord="hall" newWord="pelisse" score="0.29">pelisse</span>."Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dressing-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.868" formerWord="dressing-room" newWord="kind" score="0.868">kind</span>."

<p>After this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="day" newWord="family" score="0.994">family</span>, Jane said no more of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>indifference</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.665" formerWord="indifference" newWord="hope" score="0.665">hope</span>.

Elizabeth, who had a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> to write, went into the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>breakfast</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.725" formerWord="breakfast" newWord="influence" score="0.725">influence</span> <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.972" formerWord="room" newWord="course" score="0.972">course</span> for that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>purpose</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.828" formerWord="purpose" newWord="part" score="0.828">part</span> soon after <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>tea</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.908" formerWord="tea" newWord="time" score="0.908">time</span>; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span>'s schemes. 
<p>But on returning to the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>drawing-room</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.707" formerWord="drawing-room" newWord="room" score="0.707">room</span>, when her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>letter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="letter" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> was finished, she saw, to her infinite <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span>, there was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reason</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.676" formerWord="reason" newWord="world" score="0.676">world</span> to fear that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> had been too ingenious for her.

Their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span> was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse.

<p>"I suspected as much,"replied Elizabeth."But how did he <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>account</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="account" newWord="family" score="0.991">family</span> for it?"

Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.

<p>She expressed her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>gratitude</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="gratitude" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span> again, but it was too painful a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>subject</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.979" formerWord="subject" newWord="friend" score="0.979">friend</span> to each, to be dwelt on farther. 
<p>After walking several miles in a leisurely <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span>, and too busy to know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span> to be at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>.

Darcy was delighted with their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>engagement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.98" formerWord="engagement" newWord="friend" score="0.98">friend</span>; his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span> had given him the earliest <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="information" newWord="situation" score="0.86">situation</span> of it. 
<p>"I must ask whether you were surprised?"said Elizabeth. 
<p>"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."
<p>"That is to say, you had given your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>permission</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.267" formerWord="permission" newWord="newspaper" score="0.267">newspaper</span>.

<p>"On the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> before my going to London,"said he,"I made a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confession</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.299" formerWord="confession" newWord="representation" score="0.299">representation</span> to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.

His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>surprise</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="surprise" newWord="brother" score="0.987">brother</span> was great.

I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.684" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.684">deal</span> to her was unabated, I felt no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span> of their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> together."
<p>Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> of directing his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>. 
<p>"Did you speak from your own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>observation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.85" formerWord="observation" newWord="minute" score="0.85">minute</span>,"said she,"when you told him that my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> loved him, or merely from my <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="information" newWord="situation" score="0.86">situation</span> last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>spring</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.959" formerWord="spring" newWord="time" score="0.959">time</span>?"
<p>"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>."
<p>"And your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>assurance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.882" formerWord="assurance" newWord="heart" score="0.882">heart</span> of it, I suppose, carried immediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conviction</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="conviction" newWord="friend" score="0.962">friend</span> to him."
<p>"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>diffidence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.322" formerWord="diffidence" newWord="act" score="0.322">act</span> had prevented his depending on his own <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>judgment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.91" formerWord="judgment" newWord="rest" score="0.91">rest</span> in so anxious a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>case</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.944" formerWord="case" newWord="brother" score="0.944">brother</span>, but his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>reliance</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.613" formerWord="reliance" newWord="observation" score="0.613">observation</span> on <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mine</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.351" formerWord="mine" newWord="companion" score="0.351">companion</span> made every <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span> easy. I was obliged to confess one <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>thing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.99" formerWord="thing" newWord="man" score="0.99">man</span>, which for a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>time</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="time" newWord="family" score="0.995">family</span>, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span> had been in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>town</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="town" newWord="brother" score="0.991">brother</span> three months last <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>winter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.483" formerWord="winter" newWord="mind" score="0.483">mind</span>, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.

But his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anger</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.957" formerWord="anger" newWord="friend" score="0.957">friend</span>, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span> of your <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sister</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="sister" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>'s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now."
<p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>friend</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.994" formerWord="friend" newWord="brother" score="0.994">brother</span>; so easily guided that his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>worth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.953" formerWord="worth" newWord="man" score="0.953">man</span> was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> of Bingley, which of <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>conversation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.981" formerWord="conversation" newWord="friend" score="0.981">friend</span> till they reached the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>house</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="house" newWord="brother" score="0.989">brother</span>.

<p>The <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span> passed quietly, unmarked by <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disposition</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.799" formerWord="disposition" newWord="minute" score="0.799">minute</span> in which <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>happiness</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="happiness" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> overflows in <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mirth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.657" formerWord="mirth" newWord="voice" score="0.657">voice</span>; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>embarrassment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.369" formerWord="embarrassment" newWord="shortness" score="0.369">shortness</span>, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>family</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.996" formerWord="family" newWord="brother" score="0.996">brother</span> when her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>situation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.988" formerWord="situation" newWord="family" score="0.988">family</span> became known; she was aware that no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>one</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.909" formerWord="one" newWord="rest" score="0.909">rest</span> liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dislike</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.897" formerWord="dislike" newWord="man" score="0.897">man</span> which not all his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>fortune</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.975" formerWord="fortune" newWord="man" score="0.975">man</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consequence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.902" formerWord="consequence" newWord="situation" score="0.902">situation</span> might do away.

<p>"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! - - engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."
<p>"This is a wretched <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>beginning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.702" formerWord="beginning" newWord="rest" score="0.702">rest</span> indeed! My sole <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>dependence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.854" formerWord="dependence" newWord="conversation" score="0.854">conversation</span> was on you; and I am sure <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nobody</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.938" formerWord="nobody" newWord="family" score="0.938">family</span> else will believe me, if you do not.

<p>Jane looked at her doubtingly."Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him."
<p>"You know <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>matter</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.969" formerWord="matter" newWord="affection" score="0.969">affection</span>. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.

<p>Miss Bennet still looked all <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>amazement</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.754" formerWord="amazement" newWord="anger" score="0.754">anger</span>.

<p>"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,"cried Jane."My dear, dear Lizzy, I would - - I do congratulate you - - but are you certain? forgive the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>question</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.962" formerWord="question" newWord="time" score="0.962">time</span> - - are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"
<p>"There can be no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span> of that.

<p>"Very, very much. <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>Nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="Nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">Course</span> could give either Bingley or myself more <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>delight</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.523" formerWord="delight" newWord="observation" score="0.523">observation</span>. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>anything</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="anything" newWord="time" score="0.989">time</span> rather than marry without <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>affection</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.995" formerWord="affection" newWord="brother" score="0.995">brother</span>. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"
<p>"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all."
<p>"What do you mean?"
<p>"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry."

<p>"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.

When convinced on that <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>article</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.633" formerWord="article" newWord="love" score="0.633">love</span>, Miss Bennet had <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>nothing</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="nothing" newWord="course" score="0.991">course</span> further to wish. 
<p>"Now I am quite happy,"said she,"for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>value</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.915" formerWord="value" newWord="ball" score="0.915">ball</span> for him.

But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."
<p>Elizabeth told her the motives of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>secrecy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.443" formerWord="secrecy" newWord="fault" score="0.443">fault</span>.

What shall we do with him?

<p>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>proposal</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.263" formerWord="proposal" newWord="dream" score="0.263">dream</span>; yet was really vexed that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> should be always giving him such an epithet. 
<p>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>warmth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.97" formerWord="warmth" newWord="time" score="0.97">time</span>, as left no <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>doubt</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="doubt" newWord="family" score="0.985">family</span> of his good <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>information</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.86" formerWord="information" newWord="situation" score="0.86">situation</span>; and he soon afterwards said aloud,"Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>way</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.991" formerWord="way" newWord="friend" score="0.991">friend</span> again <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>to-day</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.37" formerWord="to-day" newWord="music" score="0.37">music</span>?"
<p>"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"said Mrs. Bennet,"to walk to Oakham Mount this <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>morning</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.987" formerWord="morning" newWord="day" score="0.987">day</span>.

<p>"It may do very well for the others,"replied Mr. Bingley;"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?"Kitty owned that she had rather stay at <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>home</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="home" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>. Darcy professed a great <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>curiosity</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.829" formerWord="curiosity" newWord="minute" score="0.829">minute</span> to see the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>view</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.375" formerWord="view" newWord="dirt" score="0.375">dirt</span> from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: 
<p>"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span> all to yourself.

<p>During their <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>walk</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="walk" newWord="friend" score="0.978">friend</span>, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>consent</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.966" formerWord="consent" newWord="brother" score="0.966">brother</span> should be asked in the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>course</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.993" formerWord="course" newWord="brother" score="0.993">brother</span> of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>evening</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.985" formerWord="evening" newWord="day" score="0.985">day</span>.

She could not determine how her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>mother</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.989" formerWord="mother" newWord="sister" score="0.989">sister</span> would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>wealth</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.715" formerWord="wealth" newWord="country" score="0.715">country</span> and <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>grandeur</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.363" formerWord="grandeur" newWord="haste" score="0.363">haste</span> would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>man</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.992" formerWord="man" newWord="brother" score="0.992">brother</span>. But whether she were violently set against the <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>match</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.653" formerWord="match" newWord="period" score="0.653">period</span>, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>manner</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.917" formerWord="manner" newWord="kind" score="0.917">kind</span> would be equally ill adapted to do <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>credit</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.817" formerWord="credit" newWord="love" score="0.817">love</span> to her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>sense</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.978" formerWord="sense" newWord="man" score="0.978">man</span>; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>joy</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.954" formerWord="joy" newWord="brother" score="0.954">brother</span>, than the first <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>vehemence</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.217" formerWord="vehemence" newWord="attitude" score="0.217">attitude</span> of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>disapprobation</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.26" formerWord="disapprobation" newWord="volume" score="0.26">volume</span>.

Have not you always hated him?"
<p>How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>confusion</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.345" formerWord="confusion" newWord="curiosity" score="0.345">curiosity</span>, of her <span class="color" title="Was: <span class='purple'>attachment</span> / Word2Vec similarity: 0.684" formerWord="attachment" newWord="deal" score="0.684">deal</span> to Mr. Darcy. 
<p>"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?"
